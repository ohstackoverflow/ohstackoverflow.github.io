    <p>I have a computer with 1 MB of RAM and no other local storage. I must use it
to accept 1 million 8-digit decimal numbers over a TCP connection, sort them,
and then send the sorted list out over another TCP connection.</p>
<p>The list of numbers may contain duplicates, which I must not discard. The code
will be placed in ROM, so I need not subtract the size of my code from the 1
MB. I already have code to drive the Ethernet port and handle TCP/IP
connections, and it requires 2 KB for its state data, including a 1 KB buffer
via which the code will read and write data. Is there a solution to this
problem?</p>
<p><strong>Sources Of Question And Answer:</strong></p>
<p>slashdot.org</p>
<p>cleaton.net</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A solution is possible only because of the difference between 1 megabyte and 1
million bytes. There are about 2 to the power 8093729.5 different ways to
choose 1 million 8-digit numbers with duplicates allowed and order
unimportant, so a machine with only 1 million bytes of RAM doesn't have enough
states to represent all the possibilities. But 1M (less 2k for TCP/IP) is
1022<em>1024</em>8 = 8372224 bits, so a solution is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1, initial solution</strong></p>
<p>This approach needs a little more than 1M, I'll refine it to fit into 1M
later.</p>
<p>I'll store a compact sorted list of numbers in the range 0 to 99999999 as a
sequence of sublists of 7-bit numbers. The first sublist holds numbers from 0
to 127, the second sublist holds numbers from 128 to 255, etc. 100000000/128
is exactly 781250, so 781250 such sublists will be needed.</p>
<p>Each sublist consists of a 2-bit sublist header followed by a sublist body.
The sublist body takes up 7 bits per sublist entry. The sublists are all
concatenated together, and the format makes it possible to tell where one
sublist ends and the next begins. The total storage required for a fully
populated list is 2<em>781250 + 7</em>1000000 = 8562500 bits, which is about 1.021
M-bytes.</p>
<p>The 4 possible sublist header values are:</p>
<p><strong>00</strong> Empty sublist, nothing follows.</p>
<p><strong>01</strong> Singleton, there is only one entry in the sublist and and next 7 bits
hold it.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> The sublist holds at least 2 distinct numbers. The entries are stored
in non-decreasing order, except that the last entry is less than or equal to
the first. This allows the end of the sublist to be identified. For example,
the numbers 2,4,6 would be stored as (4,6,2). The numbers 2,2,3,4,4 would be
stored as (2,3,4,4,2).</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> The sublist holds 2 or more repetitions of a single number. The next 7
bits give the number. Then come zero or more 7-bit entries with the value 1,
followed by a 7-bit entry with the value 0. The length of the sublist body
dictates the number of repetitions. For example, the numbers 12,12 would be
stored as (12,0), the numbers 12,12,12 would be stored as (12,1,0),
12,12,12,12 would be (12,1,1,0) and so on.</p>
<p>I start off with an empty list, read a bunch of numbers in and store them as
32 bit integers, sort the new numbers in place (using heapsort, probably) and
then merge them into a new compact sorted list. Repeat until there are no more
numbers to read, then walk the compact list once more to generate the output.</p>
<p>The line below represents memory just before the start of the list merge
operation. The "O"s are the region that hold the sorted 32-bit integers. The
"X"s are the region that hold the old compact list. The "=" signs are the
expansion room for the compact list, 7 bits for each integer in the "O"s. The
"Z"s are other random overhead.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO==========XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</pre></div>

<p>The merge routine starts reading at the leftmost "O" and at the leftmost "X",
and starts writing at the leftmost "=". The write pointer doesn't catch the
compact list read pointer until all of the new integers are merged, because
both pointers advance 2 bits for each sublist and 7 bits for each entry in the
old compact list, and there is enough extra room for the 7-bit entries for the
new numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2, cramming it into 1M</strong></p>
<p>To Squeeze the solution above into 1M, I need to make the compact list format
a bit more compact. I'll get rid of one of the sublist types, so that there
will be just 3 different possible sublist header values. Then I can use "00",
"01" and "1" as the sublist header values and save a few bits. The sublist
types are:</p>
<p>A Empty sublist, nothing follows.</p>
<p>B Singleton, there is only one entry in the sublist and and next 7 bits hold
it.</p>
<p>C The sublist holds at least 2 distinct numbers. The entries are stored in
non-decreasing order, except that the last entry is less than or equal to the
first. This allows the end of the sublist to be identified. For example, the
numbers 2,4,6 would be stored as (4,6,2). The numbers 2,2,3,4,4 would be
stored as (2,3,4,4,2).</p>
<p>D The sublist consists of 2 or more repetitions of a single number.</p>
<p>My 3 sublist header values will be "A", "B" and "C", so I need a way to
represent D-type sublists.</p>
<p>Suppose I have the C-type sublist header followed by 3 entries, such as
"C[17][101][58]". This can't be part of a valid C-type sublist as described
above, since the third entry is less than the second but more than the first.
I can use this type of construct to represent a D-type sublist. In bit terms,
anywhere I have "C{00?????}{1??????}{01?????}" is an impossible C-type
sublist. I'll use this to represent a sublist consisting of 3 or more
repetitions of a single number. The first two 7-bit words encode the number
(the "N" bits below) and are followed by zero or more {0100001} words followed
by a {0100000} word.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">For</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">example</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">repetitions</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"C{00NNNNN}{1NN0000}{0100000}"</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">repetitions</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"C{00NNNNN}{1NN0000}{0100001}{0100000}"</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">so</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">on</span>.
</pre></div>

<p>That just leaves lists that hold exactly 2 repetitions of a single number.
I'll represent those with another impossible C-type sublist pattern:
"C{0??????}{11?????}{10?????}". There's plenty of room for the 7 bits of the
number in the first 2 words, but this pattern is longer than the sublist that
it represents, which makes things a bit more complex. The five question-marks
at the end can be considered not part of the pattern, so I have:
"C{0NNNNNN}{11N????}10" as my pattern, with the number to be repeated stored
in the "N"s. That's 2 bits too long.</p>
<p>I'll have to borrow 2 bits and pay them back from the 4 unused bits in this
pattern. When reading, on encountering "C{0NNNNNN}{11N00AB}10", output 2
instances of the number in the "N"s, overwrite the "10" at the end with bits A
and B, and rewind the read pointer by 2 bits. Destructive reads are ok for
this algorithm, since each compact list gets walked only once.</p>
<p>When writing a sublist of 2 repetitions of a single number, write
"C{0NNNNNN}11N00" and set the borrowed bits counter to 2. At every write where
the borrowed bits counter is non-zero, it is decremented for each bit written
and "10" is written when the counter hits zero. So the next 2 bits written
will go into slots A and B, and then the "10" will get dropped onto the end.</p>
<p>With 3 sublist header values represented by "00", "01" and "1", I can assign
"1" to the most popular sublist type. I'll need a small table to map sublist
header values to sublist types, and I'll need an occurrence counter for each
sublist type so that I know what the best sublist header mapping is.</p>
<p>The worst case minimal representation of a fully populated compact list occurs
when all the sublist types are equally popular. In that case I save 1 bit for
every 3 sublist headers, so the list size is 2<em>781250 + 7</em>1000000 - 781250/3 =
8302083.3 bits. Rounding up to a 32 bit word boundary, thats 8302112 bits, or
1037764 bytes.</p>
<p>1M minus the 2k for TCP/IP state and buffers is 1022*1024 = 1046528 bytes,
leaving me 8764 bytes to play with.</p>
<p>But what about the process of changing the sublist header mapping ? In the
memory map below, "Z" is random overhead, "=" is free space, "X" is the
compact list.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=====XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</pre></div>

<p>Start reading at the leftmost "X" and start writing at the leftmost "=" and
work right. When it's done the compact list will be a little shorter and it
will be at the wrong end of memory:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=======
</pre></div>

<p>So then I'll need to shunt it to the right:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=======XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</pre></div>

<p>In the header mapping change process, up to 1/3 of the sublist headers will be
changing from 1-bit to 2-bit. In the worst case these will all be at the head
of the list, so I'll need at least 781250/3 bits of free storage before I
start, which takes me back to the memory requirements of the previous version
of the compact list :(</p>
<p>To get around that, I'll split the 781250 sublists into 10 sublist groups of
78125 sublists each. Each group has its own independent sublist header
mapping. Using the letters A to J for the groups:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=====AAAAAABBCCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
</pre></div>

<p>Each sublist group shrinks or stays the same during a sublist header mapping
change:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=====AAAAAABBCCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAA=====BBCCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABB=====CCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCC======DDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDD======EEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEE======FFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFF======GGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGG=======HHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHH=======IJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHI=======JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ=======
ZZZ=======AAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
</pre></div>

<p>The worst case temporary expansion of a sublist group during a mapping change
is 78125/3 = 26042 bits, under 4k. If I allow 4k plus the 1037764 bytes for a
fully populated compact list, that leaves me 8764 - 4096 = 4668 bytes for the
"Z"s in the memory map.</p>
<p>That should be plenty for the 10 sublist header mapping tables, 30 sublist
header occurrence counts and the other few counters, pointers and small
buffers I'll need, and space I've used without noticing, like stack space for
function call return addresses and local variables.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3, how long would it take to run?</strong></p>
<p>With an empty compact list the 1-bit list header will be used for an empty
sublist, and the starting size of the list will be 781250 bits. In the worst
case the list grows 8 bits for each number added, so 32 + 8 = 40 bits of free
space are needed for each of the 32-bit numbers to be placed at the top of the
list buffer and then sorted and merged. In the worst case, changing the
sublist header mapping results in a space usage of 2<em>781250 + 7</em>entries -
781250/3 bits.</p>
<p>With a policy of changing the sublist header mapping after every fifth merge
once there are at least 800000 numbers in the list, a worst case run would
involve a total of about 30M of compact list reading and writing activity.</p>

<p><strong>Editor:</strong> There is no proof of the maximum memory requirements offered by
the author either in this post or in his blogs. Since the number of bits
necessary to encode a value depends on the values previously encoded, such a
proof is likely non-trivial. The author notes that the largest encoded size he
could stumble upon empirically was <code>1011732</code>, and chose the buffer size

    <p>Everyone runs into syntax errors. Even experienced programmers make typos. For
newcomers, it's just part of the learning process. However, it's often easy to
interpret error messages such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PHP Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '{' in index.php on line 20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unexpected symbol isn't always the real culprit. But the line number gives
a rough idea of where to start looking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always look at the <strong>code context</strong>. The syntax mistake often hides in the
mentioned <em>or</em> in <strong>previous code lines</strong>. Compare your code against syntax
examples from the manual.</p>

<p>If your <em>browser</em> displays error messages such as "SyntaxError: illegal

<p><strong>Syntax errors raised on vendor code:</strong> Finally, consider that if the syntax
error was not raised by editing your codebase, but after an external vendor
package install or upgrade, it could be due to PHP version incompatibility, so
check the vendor's requirements against your platform setup.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>What are the syntax errors?</h4>
<p>PHP belongs to the C-style and imperative programming languages. It has rigid
grammar rules, which it cannot recover from when encountering misplaced
symbols or identifiers. It can't guess your coding intentions.</p>
<p><img alt="Function definition syntax abstract" src="images/jY6k7.gif"></p>
<h4>Most important tips</h4>
<p>There are a few basic precautions you can always take:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use proper <strong>code indentation</strong> , or adopt any lofty coding style. Readability prevents irregularities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an <strong><em>IDE</em></strong> or editor for PHP with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>. Which also help with parentheses/bracket balancing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Expected: semicolon" src="images/z2FBC.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Read the language reference and examples in the manual. Twice, to become somewhat proficient.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to interpret parser errors</h4>
<p>A typical syntax error message reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected <strong>T_STRING</strong> , expecting <strong>'<code>;</code>'</strong> in
<em>file.php</em> on <strong>line</strong> <em>217</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which lists the <em>possible</em> location of a syntax mistake. See the mentioned
<strong>file name</strong> and <strong>line number</strong>.</p>
<p>A moniker such as <code>T_STRING</code> explains which symbol the parser/tokenizer
couldn't process finally. This isn't necessarily the cause of the syntax
mistake, however.</p>
<p>It's important to look into <strong>previous code lines</strong> as well. Often syntax
errors are just mishaps that happened earlier. The error line number is just
where the parser conclusively gave up to process it all.</p>
<h3>Solving syntax errors</h3>
<p>There are many approaches to narrow down and fix syntax hiccups.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open the mentioned source file. Look at the mentioned <strong>code line</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For runaway strings and misplaced operators, this is usually where you find the culprit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the line left to right and imagine what each symbol does.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>More regularly you need to look at <strong>preceding lines</strong> as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In particular, missing <code>;</code> semicolons are missing at the previous line ends/statement. (At least from the stylistic viewpoint. )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>{</code> code blocks <code>}</code> are incorrectly closed or nested, you may need to investigate even further up the source code. Use proper <em>code indentation</em> to simplify that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the <strong>syntax colorization</strong>!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strings and variables and constants should all have different colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operators <code>+-*/.</code> should be tinted distinct as well. Else they might be in the wrong context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you see string colorization extend too far or too short, then you have found an unescaped or missing closing <code>"</code> or <code>'</code> string marker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having two same-colored punctuation characters next to each other can also mean trouble. Usually, operators are lone if it's not <code>++</code>, <code>--</code>, or parentheses following an operator. Two strings/identifiers directly following each other are incorrect in most contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whitespace is your friend</strong>. Follow <em>any</em> coding style. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break up long lines temporarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can freely <strong>add newlines</strong> between operators or constants and strings. The parser will then concretize the line number for parsing errors. Instead of looking at the very lengthy code, you can isolate the missing or misplaced syntax symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split up complex <code>if</code> statements into distinct or nested <code>if</code> conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of lengthy math formulas or logic chains, use temporary variables to simplify the code. (More readable = fewer errors.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add newlines between:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code you can easily identify as correct,</p>
</li>
<li>The parts you're unsure about,</li>
<li>And the lines which the parser complains about.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Partitioning up long code blocks <em>really</em> helps to locate the origin of syntax
errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment out</strong> offending code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you can't isolate the problem source, start to comment out (and thus temporarily remove) blocks of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as you got rid of the parsing error, you have found the problem source. Look more closely there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes you want to temporarily remove complete function/method blocks. (In case of unmatched curly braces and wrongly indented code.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you can't resolve the syntax issue, try to <strong>rewrite</strong> the commented out sections <strong>from scratch</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a newcomer, avoid some of the confusing syntax constructs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ternary <code>? :</code> condition operator can compact code and is useful indeed. But it doesn't aid readability in all cases. Prefer plain <code>if</code> statements while unversed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PHP's alternative syntax (<code>if:</code>/<code>elseif:</code>/<code>endif;</code>) is common for templates, but arguably less easy to follow than normal <code>{</code> code <code>}</code> blocks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most prevalent newcomer mistakes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Missing semicolons <code>;</code> for terminating statements/lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mismatched string quotes for <code>"</code> or <code>'</code> and unescaped quotes within.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forgotten operators, in particular for the string <code>.</code> concatenation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unbalanced <code>(</code> parentheses <code>)</code>. Count them in the reported line. Are there an equal number of them?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't forget that solving one syntax problem can uncover the next.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you make one issue go away, but other crops up in some code below, you're mostly on the right path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If after editing a new syntax error crops up in the same line, then your attempted change was possibly a failure. (Not always though.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restore a backup of previously working code, if you can't fix it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a source code versioning system. You can always view a <code>diff</code> of the broken and last working version. Which might be enlightening as to what the syntax problem is.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invisible stray Unicode characters</strong> : In some cases, you need to use a hexeditor or different editor/viewer on your source. Some problems cannot be found just from looking at your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Try <code>grep --color -P -n "\[\x80-\xFF\]" file.php</code> as the first measure to find non-ASCII symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular BOMs, zero-width spaces, or non-breaking spaces, and smart quotes regularly can find their way into the source code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take care of which <strong>type of linebreaks</strong> are saved in files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PHP just honors <code>\n</code> newlines, not <code>\r</code> carriage returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is occasionally an issue for MacOS users (even on OS X for misconfigured editors).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It often only surfaces as an issue when single-line <code>//</code> or <code>#</code> comments are used. Multiline <code>/*...*/</code> comments do seldom disturb the parser when linebreaks get ignored.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your <strong>syntax error does not transmit over the web</strong> : It happens that you have a syntax error on your machine. But posting the very same file online does not exhibit it anymore. Which can only mean one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are looking at the wrong file!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or your code contained invisible stray Unicode (see above). You can easily find out: Just copy your code back from the web form into your text editor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your <strong>PHP version</strong>. Not all syntax constructs are available on every server.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>php -v</code> for the command line interpreter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;?php phpinfo();</code> for the one invoked through the webserver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those aren't necessarily the same. In particular when working with frameworks,
you will them to match up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't use PHP's reserved keywords as identifiers for functions/methods, classes or constants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trial-and-error is your last resort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all else fails, you can always <strong>google</strong> your error message. Syntax
symbols aren't as easy to search for (Stack Overflow itself is indexed by
SymbolHound though). Therefore it may take looking through a few more pages
before you find something relevant.</p>

<h4>White screen of death</h4>
<p>If your website is just blank, then typically a syntax error is the cause.
Enable their display with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>error_reporting = E_ALL</code></li>
<li><code>display_errors = 1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In your <code>php.ini</code> generally, or via <code>.htaccess</code> for mod_php, or even
<code>.user.ini</code> with FastCGI setups.</p>
<p>Enabling it within the broken script is too late because PHP can't even
interpret/run the first line. A quick workaround is crafting a wrapper script,
say <code>test.php</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
   <span class="nb">error_reporting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">E_ALL</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="nb">ini_set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"display_errors"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="k">include</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"./broken-script.php"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Then invoke the failing code by accessing this wrapper script.</p>
<p>It also helps to enable PHP's <code>error_log</code> and look into your webserver's
<code>error.log</code> when a script crashes with HTTP 500 responses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I think this topic is totally overdiscussed/overcomplicated. Using an IDE is
THE way to go to completely avoid any syntax errors. I would even say that
working without an IDE is kind of unprofessional. Why? Because modern IDEs
check your syntax after every character you type. When you code and your
entire line turns red, and a big warning notice shows you the exact type and
the exact position of the syntax error, then there's absolutely no need to
search for another solution.</p>
<h3>Using a syntax-checking IDE means:</h3>
<p><strong>You'll (effectively) never run into syntax errors again, simply because you
see them right as you type. Seriously.</strong></p>
<p><em>Excellent IDEs with syntax check (all of them are available for Linux,
Windows and Mac):</em></p>

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>I am trying to learn the best way to write queries. I also understand the
importance of being consistent. Until now, I have randomly used single quotes,
double quotes, and backticks without any real thought.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$query = 'INSERT INTO table (id, col1, col2) VALUES (NULL, val1, val2)';
</pre></div>

<p>Also, in the above example, consider that <code>table</code>, <code>col1</code>, <code>val1</code>, etc. may be
variables.</p>
<p>What is the standard for this? What do you do?</p>
<p>I've been reading answers to similar questions on here for about 20 minutes,
but it seems like there is no definitive answer to this question.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Backticks are to be used for table and column identifiers, but are only
necessary when the identifier is a MySQL reserved keyword, or when the
identifier contains whitespace characters or characters beyond a limited set
(see below) It is often recommended to avoid using reserved keywords as column
or table identifiers when possible, avoiding the quoting issue.</p>
<p>Single quotes should be used for string values like in the <code>VALUES()</code> list.
Double quotes are supported by MySQL for string values as well, but single
quotes are more widely accepted by other RDBMS, so it is a good habit to use
single quotes instead of double.</p>
<p>MySQL also expects <code>DATE</code> and <code>DATETIME</code> literal values to be single-quoted as
strings like <code>'2001-01-01 00:00:00'</code>. Consult the Date and Time Literals
documentation for more details, in particular alternatives to using the hyphen
<code>-</code> as a segment delimiter in date strings.</p>
<p>So using your example, I would double-quote the PHP string and use single
quotes on the values <code>'val1', 'val2'</code>. <code>NULL</code> is a MySQL keyword, and a
special (non)-value, and is therefore unquoted.</p>
<p>None of these table or column identifiers are reserved words or make use of
characters requiring quoting, but I've quoted them anyway with backticks (more
on this later...).</p>
<p>Functions native to the RDBMS (for example, <code>NOW()</code> in MySQL) should not be
quoted, although their arguments are subject to the same string or identifier
quoting rules already mentioned.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">Backtick</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n n-Quoted">`)</span>
<span class="n n-Quoted">table &amp; column ───────┬─────┬──┬──┬──┬────┬──┬────┬──┬────┬──┬───────┐</span>

<span class="n n-Quoted">$query = " **INSERT INTO `</span><span class="k">table</span><span class="n n-Quoted">` (`</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="n n-Quoted">`, `</span><span class="n">col1</span><span class="n n-Quoted">`, `</span><span class="n">col2</span><span class="n n-Quoted">`, `</span><span class="kt">date</span><span class="n n-Quoted">`, `</span><span class="n">updated</span><span class="n n-Quoted">`) </span>
<span class="n n-Quoted">                       VALUES (NULL, 'val1', 'val2', '2001-01-01', NOW())** ";</span>
<span class="n n-Quoted">                               ↑↑↑↑  ↑    ↑  ↑    ↑  ↑          ↑  ↑↑↑↑↑ </span>
<span class="n n-Quoted">Unquoted keyword          ─────┴┴┴┘  │    │  │    │  │          │  │││││</span>
<span class="n n-Quoted">Single-quoted (') strings ───────────┴────┴──┴────┘  │          │  │││││</span>

</pre></div>

<h4>Variable interpolation</h4>
<p>The quoting patterns for variables do not change, although if you intend to
interpolate the variables directly in a string, it must be double-quoted in
PHP. Just make sure that you have properly escaped the variables for use in
SQL. (It is recommended to use an API supporting prepared statements instead,
as protection against SQL injection).</p>

<h4>Prepared statements</h4>
<p>When working with prepared statements, consult the documentation to determine
whether or not the statement's placeholders must be quoted. The most popular
APIs available in PHP, PDO and MySQLi, expect <em>unquoted</em> placeholders, as do
most prepared statement APIs in other languages:</p>

<h4>Characters requring backtick quoting in identifiers:</h4>
<p>According to MySQL documentation, you do not need to quote (backtick)
identifiers using the following character set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASCII: <code>[0-9,a-z,A-Z$_]</code> (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar,
underscore)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use characters beyond that set as table or column identifiers,
including whitespace for example, but then you <em>must</em> quote (backtick) them.</p>
<p>Also, although numbers are valid characters for identifiers, identifiers
cannot consist solely of numbers. If they do they must be wrapped in
backticks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There are two types of quotes in MySQL:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>'</code> for enclosing string literals</li>
<li>``` for enclosing identifiers such as table and column names</li>
</ol>
<p>And then there is <code>"</code> which is a special case. It could be used for <em>one</em> of
above-mentioned purposes at a time depending on MySQL server's <code>sql_mode</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>By default</em> the <code>"</code> character can be used to enclose string literals just like <code>'</code>
</li>
<li>In <code>ANSI_QUOTES</code> mode the <code>"</code> character can be used to enclose identifiers just like ```</li>
</ol>
<h4>The following query will produce different results (or errors) depending</h4>
<p>on SQL mode:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">SELECT "column" FROM table WHERE foo = "bar"
</pre></div>

<h4>ANSI_QUOTES disabled</h4>
<p>The query will select the string literal <code>"column"</code> where column <code>foo</code> is
equal to string <code>"bar"</code></p>
<h4>ANSI_QUOTES enabled</h4>
<p>The query will select the column <code>column</code> where column <code>foo</code> is equal to
column <code>bar</code></p>
<h4>When to use what</h4>
<ul>
<li>I suggest that you avoid using <code>"</code> so that your code becomes independent of SQL modes</li>
<li>Always quote identifiers since it is a good practice (quite a few questions on SO discuss this)</li>
</ul>
