    <p>I'm trying to use brownian motion to create a group of random moving
particles. http://jsfiddle.net/J75Em/16/</p>
<p>So far I've got the particles moving randomly but I'm not sure how to set the
forward direction to make it look more natural.</p>
<p>I've tried to use the change in x and y axis to calculate rotation using atan,
you can see this by uncommenting rotate but this doesn't seem to perform well.</p>
<p>Is this the right approach for this type of movement? thanks;</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>This is pretty neat!</p>
<p>You are sort of going about it the right way but you should actually use the
atan2 function. This removes the need for any 0 checks.</p>
<p>The atan2 function gives you an angle which is anticlockwise from the positive
x vector</p>
<p>(1, 0) ---&gt;</p>
<p>The bees are 90 degrees off from this starting angle so you must subtract 90
degrees from the direction. (depending on which way round you do the dy and dx
calculation, you might need to add)</p>
<p>You could find that the direction changes rapidly, so you could consider
limiting the next change to a set of changes that cause an angle change below
some threshold. This will make the movement a little smoother.</p>
<p>I would actually go about it by generating an angle between say -pi/8 and pi/8
radians, and a random length. Essentially using polar coordinates. Then add
this new random polar offset to the x and y position like</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">newX = currentX + (randomLength * cos(randomAngle + currentAngle)) and 
newY = currentY + (randomLength * sin(randomAngle + currentAngle))
</pre></div>

<p>If you work with angles you can also get more natural effects like if you want
the bees to stay within a certain area, you can force a bias towards the
center of the area as they get closer and closer to the edge.</p>
<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>So I've taken a closer look. The trouble is that you expect .rotate to set the
rotation when it actually <strong>adds to the rotation</strong></p>
<p>There are 2 options for fixing this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rotate by the difference between the previous and the current angle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the rotation using the .transform method</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see solution 2 in action here http://jsfiddle.net/c5A2A/</p>

    <p>I could not understand how to update Q values for tic tac toe game. I read all
about that but I could not imagine how to do this. I read that Q value is
updated end of the game, but I haven't understand that if there is Q value for
each action ?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You have a <code>Q</code> value for each state-action pair. You update one <code>Q</code> value
after every action you perform. More precisely, if applying action <code>a1</code> from
state <code>s1</code> gets you into state <code>s2</code> and brings you some reward <code>r</code>, then you
update <code>Q(s1, a1)</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Q(s1, a1) = Q(s1, a1) + learning_rate * (r + discount_factor * max Q(s2, _) - Q(s1, a1))
</pre></div>

<p>In many games, such as tic-tac-toe you don't get rewards until the end of the
game, that's why you have to run the algorithm through several episodes.
That's how information about utility of final states is propagated to other
states.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The problem with the standard Q Learning algorithm is that it just takes too
long to propagate the values from the final to the first move because you only
know the outcome of the game at the end of it.</p>
<p>Therefore the Q Learning algorithm should be modified. The following paper
gives some details on possible modifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>a non negative reward is given after the game ends (except for draw), then the Q updates is not performed at every action step (which changes nothing), but only after the end of the game</li>
<li>the Q updates is performed by propagating its new value from the last move backward to the first move</li>
<li>another update formula is incorporated that also considers the opponent point of view because of the turn-taking nature of two-player game</li>
</ol>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This paper reports our experiment on applying Q Learning algorithm for
learning to play Tic-tac-toe. The original algorithm is modified by updating
the Q value only when the game terminates, propagating the update process
from the final move backward to the first move, and incorporating a new
update rule. We evaluate the agent performance using full-board and partial-
board representations. In this evaluation, the agent plays the tic-tac-toe
game against human players. The evaluation results show that the performance
of modified Q Learning algorithm with partial-board representation is
comparable to that of human players.</p>

    <p>I understand, to a certain degree, how the algorithm works. What I don't fully

<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In MCTS, there's not much of a point in a recursive implementation (which is common in other tree search algorithms like the minimax-based ones), because you always go "through" a game in sequences from current game state (root node) till game states you choose to evaluate (terminal game states, unless you choose to go with a non-standard implementation using a depth limit on the play-out phase and a heuristic evaluation function). The much more obvious implementation using <code>while</code> loops is just fine.</li>
<li>If it's your first time implementing the algorithm, I'd recommend just going for a single-threaded implementation first. It is a relatively easy algorithm to parallelize though, there are multiple papers on that. You can simply run multiple simulations (where simulation = selection + expansion + playout + backpropagation) in parallel. You can try to make sure everything gets updated cleanly during backpropagation, but you can also simply decide to not use any locks / blocking etc. at all, there's already enough randomness in all the simulations anyway so if you lose information from a couple of simulations here and there due to naively-implemented parallelization it really doesn't hurt too much.</li>
<li>As for data structures, unlike algorithms like <code>minimax</code>, you actually do need to explicitly build a tree and store it in memory (it is built up gradually as the algorithm is running). So, you'll want a general tree data structure with <code>Nodes</code> that have a list of successor / child <code>Nodes</code>, and also a pointer back to the parent <code>Node</code> (required for backpropagation of simulation outcomes).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What type of limits would we expect to see on a single machine? (could we
run concurrently across many cores... gpu maybe?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running across many cores can be done yes (see point about parallelization
above). I don't see any part of the algorithm being particularly well-suited
for GPU implementations (there are no large matrix multiplications or anything
like that), so GPU is unlikely to be interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If each branch results in a completely new game being played, (this could

reuse branches already played?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the most commonly-described implementation, the algorithm creates only one
new node to store in memory per iteration/simulation in the expansion phase
(the first node encountered after the Selection phase). All other game states
generated in the play-out phase of the same simulation do not get any nodes to
store in memory at all. This keeps memory usage in check, it means your tree
only grows relatively slowly (at a rate of 1 node per simulation). It does
mean you get slightly less re-usage of previously-simulated branches, because
you don't store everything you see in memory. You can choose to implement a
different strategy for the expansion phase (for example, create new nodes for
<em>all</em> game states generated in the play-out phase). You'll have to carefully
monitor memory usage if you do this though.</p>
