    <p>I'm having a huge block trying to understand "trees" while making a Tic-Tac-
Toe bot. I understand the concept, but I can't figure out to implement them.</p>
<p>Can someone show me an example of how a tree should be generated for such a
case? Or a good tutorial on generating trees? I guess the hard part is
generating partial trees. I know how to implement generating a whole tree, but
not parts of it.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Imagine that at any point in a tic-tac-toe board, every single possible move
is a branch. The current state of the board is the root. One move is a branch.
Now pretend (one at a time), that each branch becomes the current state. Each
possible move becomes a new branch. The leaf of the tree is when the last move
is made and the board is full.</p>
<p>The reason you need to have a tree, is that once it is built, you need to
figure out which branch has the most leaves that are 'WIN' scenarios. You
build the branch of all possible outcomes, add up the total number of WINs,
and then make the move that has the chance to end up with the most wins.</p>
<p>Make the tree something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">Node</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="n">public</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">list</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Node</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">m_branches</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="err">BoardState</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">m_board</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="err">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">m_winCount</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">list</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">Node</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">tree</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, you iterate through the list of branches in the tree, and for each
branch, iterate through its branches. This can be done with a recursive
function:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">recursiveTreeWalk</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">std</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nd">list</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">Node</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;&amp;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">partialTree</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

<span class="w">   </span><span class="err">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">each</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">branch</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">tree</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="err">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">node</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">has</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">no</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">branches</span>
<span class="w">           </span><span class="err">calculate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">win</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">1/0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="err">else</span>
<span class="w">           </span><span class="err">recursiveTreeWalk(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">branch</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">)</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="w">   </span><span class="err">partialTree.m_winCount</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">sum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">branch</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">wins</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">initial</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">call</span>
<span class="nt">recursiveTreeWalk</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">tree</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Very pseudo-code.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I don't think you need to keep a tree in memory. You simply need to implement
a recursive function that works something like:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Move getBestMove(Board state, boolean myTurn)
</pre></div>

<p>Then you simply recurse until you've reached a winning, losing or draw-state.</p>
<p>The call-stack would over time look like a tree if you drew it on paper. You
should return the move that leads to a node at which the opponent (definitely
/ most likely) looses (even though he also plays using getBestMove)</p>
<p>For a state-space as little as tic-tac-toe however, you could simply do a full
look-up-table with the best moves! :-)</p>

    <p>I have asked other AI folk this question, but I haven't really been given an
answer that satisfied me.</p>
<p>For anyone else that has programmed an artificial neural network before, how
do you test for its correctness?</p>
<p>I guess, another way to put it is, how does one debug the code behind a neural
network?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Correctness is a funny concept in most of "soft computing." The best I can
tell you is: "a neural network is correct when it consistently satisfies the
parameters of it's design." You do this by training it with data, and then
verifying with other data, and having a feedback loop in the middle which lets
you know if the neural network is functioning appropriately.</p>
<p>This is of-course the case only for neural networks that are large enough
where a direct proof of correctness is not possible. It is possible to <em>prove</em>
that a neural network is correct through analysis if you are attempting to
build a neural network that learns XOR or something similar, but for that
class of problem an aNN is seldom necessary.</p>

    <p>I'm trying to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Genetic
algorithm. My genome is a permutation of a vertex in graph (path for
salesman).</p>
<p>How should I perform the crossover operation over my genomes?</p>
<p>Where can I find implementations of my problem in C#?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You should check "Genetic Algorithm Solution of the TSP Avoiding Special
Crossover and Mutation" by Gokturk Ucoluk. It gives an overview of the special
crossover operators for permutations and proposes a clever representation of
permutations that works well with standard crossover (i.e. crossing over two
permutations always produces two permutations).</p>
<p>The key insight is to represent the permutation as its inversion sequence,
i.e. for each element <code>i</code>, store in <code>a[i]</code> how many elements larger than <code>i</code>
are to the left of <code>i</code> in the permutation. Unlike the direct representation,
the only constraint on <code>a[i]</code> is local, i.e. <code>a[i]</code> cannot be larger than <code>N -
i</code>. This means that simple crossover of two valid inversion sequences always
produces two valid inversion sequences - no need for special handling of
repeating elements.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Rather than using the standard GA cross-over technique (as outlined by
MusiGenesis), it's better to use ordered cross-over for the Travelling
Salesman problem.</p>
<p>The usual approach doesn't work so well for the TSP because the fitness
function is very sensitive to the relative positions of the different cities
in the evolved route rather than their absolute positions. For example, if you
were visiting all European capitals, the shortest route doesn't really depend
on whether you visit Bratislava 1st, 2nd, or 9th. What's more important is
that you visit it immediately before or immediately after visiting Vienna
rather than visiting Helsinki, Athens and 6 other capitals in between.</p>
<p>Of course, as mjv also points out, the traditional cross-over will also
introduce duplicates in your route. If one parent has Paris in position 2 and
another has Paris in position 14, cross-over could result in one evolved route
that visits Paris twice (and misses out another city), and another evolved
route that doesn't visit it at all. The ordered cross-over genetic operator
does not suffer from this problem. It preserves the elements and modifies the
ordering.</p>
