    <p>I have a whole bunch of tests on variables in a bash (3.00) shell script where
if the variable is not set, then it assigns a default, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">if<span class="w"> </span>[<span class="w"> </span>-z<span class="w"> </span>"<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">VARIABLE</span><span class="cp">}</span>"<span class="w"> </span>];<span class="w"> </span>then<span class="w"> </span>

else<span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">    </span>FOO=<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">VARIABLE</span><span class="cp">}</span>
fi
</pre></div>

<p>I seem to recall there's some syntax to doing this in one line, something
resembling a ternary operator, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">FOO=<span class="cp">${</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">VARIABLE</span><span class="cp">}</span><span class="w"> </span>:<span class="w"> </span>'default'<span class="w"> </span>}
</pre></div>

<p>(though I know that won't work...)</p>
<p>Am I crazy, or does something like that exist?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Very close to what you posted, actually. You can use something called Bash
parameter expansion to accomplish this.</p>
<p>To get the assigned value, or <code>default</code> if it's missing:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">FOO</span><span class="s s-Atom">=</span><span class="s2">"${VARIABLE:-default}"</span>  <span class="s s-Atom">#</span> <span class="nv">If</span> <span class="s s-Atom">variable</span> <span class="o">not</span> <span class="s s-Atom">set</span> <span class="s s-Atom">or</span> <span class="s s-Atom">null</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s s-Atom">use</span> <span class="s s-Atom">default</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="s s-Atom">#</span> <span class="nv">If</span> <span class="nv">VARIABLE</span> <span class="s s-Atom">was</span> <span class="s s-Atom">unset</span> <span class="s s-Atom">or</span> <span class="s s-Atom">null</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s s-Atom">it</span> <span class="s s-Atom">still</span> <span class="o">is</span> <span class="s s-Atom">after</span> <span class="nf">this</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s s-Atom">no</span> <span class="s s-Atom">assignment</span> <span class="s s-Atom">done</span><span class="p">).</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or to assign <code>default</code> to <code>VARIABLE</code> at the same time:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">FOO</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"${VARIABLE:=default}"</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># If variable not set or null, set it to default.</span>
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>For command line arguments:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">VARIABLE</span><span class="s s-Atom">=</span><span class="s2">"${1:-$DEFAULTVALUE}"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>which assigns to <code>VARIABLE</code> the value of the 1st argument passed to the script
or the value of <code>DEFAULTVALUE</code> if no such argument was passed. Quoting
prevents globbing and word splitting.</p>

    <p>I've seen these words a lot around Subversion (and I guess general repository)
discussions.<br>
I have been using <strong>SVN</strong> for my projects for the last few years, but I've
never grasped the complete concept of these directories.</p>
<p>What do they mean?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Hmm, not sure I agree with Nick re tag being similar to a branch. A tag is
just a marker</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trunk</strong> would be the main body of development, originating from the start of the project until the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Branch</strong> will be a copy of code derived from a certain point in the trunk that is used for applying major changes to the code while preserving the integrity of the code in the trunk. If the major changes work according to plan, they are usually merged back into the trunk. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tag</strong> will be a point in time on the trunk or a branch that you wish to preserve. The two main reasons for preservation would be that either this is a major release of the software, whether alpha, beta, RC or RTM, or this is the most stable point of the software before major revisions on the trunk were applied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In open source projects, major branches that are not accepted into the trunk
by the project stakeholders can become the bases for <em>forks</em> -- e.g., totally
separate projects that share a common origin with other source code.</p>
<p>The branch and tag subtrees are distinguished from the trunk in the following
ways:</p>
<p>Subversion allows sysadmins to create <em>hook scripts</em> which are triggered for
execution when certain events occur; for instance, committing a change to the
repository. It is very common for a typical Subversion repository
implementation to treat any path containing "/tag/" to be write-protected
after creation; the net result is that tags, once created, are immutable (at
least to "ordinary" users). This is done via the hook scripts, which enforce
the immutability by preventing further changes if <strong>tag</strong> is a parent node of
the changed object.</p>
<p>Subversion also has added features, since version 1.5, relating to "branch
merge tracking" so that changes committed to a <strong>branch</strong> can be merged back
into the trunk with support for incremental, "smart" merging.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>First of all, as @AndrewFinnell and @KenLiu point out, in SVN the directory
names themselves mean nothing -- "trunk, branches and tags" are simply a
common convention that is used by most repositories. Not all projects use all
of the directories (it's reasonably common not to use "tags" at all), and in
fact, nothing is stopping you from calling them anything you'd like, though
breaking convention is often confusing.</p>
<p>I'll describe probably the most common usage scenario of branches and tags,
and give an example scenario of how they are used.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trunk</strong> : The main development area. This is where your next major release of the code lives, and generally has all the newest features. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Branches</strong> : Every time you release a major version, it gets a branch created. This allows you to do bug fixes and make a new release without having to release the newest - possibly unfinished or untested - features. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> : Every time you release a version (final release, release candidates (RC), and betas) you make a tag for it. This gives you a point-in-time copy of the code as it was at that state, allowing you to go back and reproduce any bugs if necessary in a past version, or re-release a past version exactly as it was. Branches and tags in SVN are lightweight - on the server, it does not make a full copy of the files, just a marker saying "these files were copied at this revision" that only takes up a few bytes. With this in mind, you should never be concerned about creating a tag for any released code. As I said earlier, tags are often omitted and instead, a changelog or other document clarifies the revision number when a release is made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>For example, let's say you start a new project. You start working in "trunk",
on what will eventually be released as version 1.0.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>trunk/ - development version, soon to be 1.0</strong></li>
<li>branches/ - empty</li>
</ul>
<p>Once 1.0.0 is finished, you branch trunk into a new "1.0" branch, and create a
"1.0.0" tag. Now work on what will eventually be 1.1 continues in trunk.</p>
<ul>
<li>trunk/ - development version, <strong>soon to be 1.1</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>branches/1.0 - 1.0.0 release version</strong></li>
<li><strong>tags/1.0.0 - 1.0.0 release version</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You come across some bugs in the code, and fix them in trunk, and then merge
the fixes over to the 1.0 branch. You can also do the opposite, and fix the
bugs in the 1.0 branch and then merge them back to trunk, but commonly
projects stick with merging one-way only to lessen the chance of missing
something. Sometimes a bug can only be fixed in 1.0 because it is obsolete in
1.1. It doesn't really matter: you only want to make sure that you don't
release 1.1 with the same bugs that have been fixed in 1.0.</p>
<ul>
<li>trunk/ - development version, soon to be 1.1</li>
<li>branches/1.0 - <strong>upcoming 1.0.1 release</strong>
</li>
<li>tags/1.0.0 - 1.0.0 release version</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you find enough bugs (or maybe one critical bug), you decide to do a
1.0.1 release. So you make a tag "1.0.1" from the 1.0 branch, and release the
code. At this point, trunk will contain what will be 1.1, and the "1.0" branch
contains 1.0.1 code. The next time you release an update to 1.0, it would be
1.0.2.</p>
<ul>
<li>trunk/ - development version, soon to be 1.1</li>
<li>branches/1.0 - <strong>upcoming 1.0.2 release</strong>
</li>
<li>tags/1.0.0 - 1.0.0 release version</li>
<li><strong>tags/1.0.1 - 1.0.1 release version</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually you are almost ready to release 1.1, but you want to do a beta
first. In this case, you likely do a "1.1" branch, and a "1.1beta1" tag. Now,
work on what will be 1.2 (or 2.0 maybe) continues in trunk, but work on 1.1
continues in the "1.1" branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>trunk/ - development version, <strong>soon to be 1.2</strong>
</li>
<li>branches/1.0 - upcoming 1.0.2 release</li>
<li><strong>branches/1.1 - upcoming 1.1.0 release</strong></li>
<li>tags/1.0.0 - 1.0.0 release version</li>
<li>tags/1.0.1 - 1.0.1 release version</li>
<li><strong>tags/1.1beta1 - 1.1 beta 1 release version</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you release 1.1 final, you do a "1.1" tag from the "1.1" branch.</p>
<p>You can also continue to maintain 1.0 if you'd like, porting bug fixes between
all three branches (1.0, 1.1, and trunk). The important takeaway is that for
every main version of the software you are maintaining, you have a branch that
contains the latest version of code for that version.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another use of branches is for features. This is where you branch trunk (or
one of your release branches) and work on a new feature in isolation. Once the
feature is completed, you merge it back in and remove the branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>trunk/ - development version, soon to be 1.2</li>
<li>branches/1.1 - upcoming 1.1.0 release</li>
<li><strong>branches/ui-rewrite - experimental feature branch</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of this is when you're working on something disruptive (that would
hold up or interfere with other people from doing their work), something
experimental (that may not even make it in), or possibly just something that
takes a long time (and you're afraid if it holding up a 1.2 release when
you're ready to branch 1.2 from trunk), you can do it in isolation in branch.
Generally you keep it up to date with trunk by merging changes into it all the
time, which makes it easier to re-integrate (merge back to trunk) when you're
finished.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also note, the versioning scheme I used here is just one of many. Some teams
would do bug fix/maintenance releases as 1.1, 1.2, etc., and major changes as
1.x, 2.x, etc. The usage here is the same, but you may name the branch "1" or
"1.x" instead of "1.0" or "1.0.x". (Aside, semantic versioning is a good guide
on how to do version numbers).</p>

    <p>I have a program that writes information to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>, and I need
to process the <code>stderr</code> with <code>grep</code>, leaving <code>stdout</code> aside.</p>
<p>Using a temporary file, one could do it in two steps:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">command &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; temp.file
grep 'something' temp.file
</pre></div>

<p>But how can this be achieved without temp files, using one command and pipes?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>First redirect stderr to stdout — the pipe; then redirect stdout to
<code>/dev/null</code> (without changing where stderr is going):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">command 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null | grep 'something'
</pre></div>

<p>For the details of I/O redirection in all its variety, see the chapter on
Redirections in the Bash reference manual.</p>
<p>Note that the sequence of I/O redirections is interpreted left-to-right, but
pipes are set up before the I/O redirections are interpreted. File descriptors
such as 1 and 2 are references to open file descriptions. The operation <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>
makes file descriptor 2 aka stderr refer to the same open file description as
file descriptor 1 aka stdout is currently referring to (see <code>dup2()</code> and
<code>open()</code>). The operation <code>&gt;/dev/null</code> then changes file descriptor 1 so that
it refers to an open file description for <code>/dev/null</code>, but that doesn't change
the fact that file descriptor 2 refers to the open file description which file
descriptor 1 was originally pointing to — namely, the pipe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Or to swap the output from standard error and standard output over, use:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">command 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3
</pre></div>

<p>This creates a new file descriptor (3) and assigns it to the same place as 1
(standard output), then assigns fd 1 (standard output) to the same place as fd
2 (standard error) and finally assigns fd 2 (standard error) to the same place
as fd 3 (standard output).</p>
<p>Standard error is now available as standard output and the old standard output
is preserved in standard error. This may be overkill, but it hopefully gives
more details on Bash file descriptors (there are nine available to each
process).</p>
