    <p>I have a couple of numerical datasets that I need to create a concept
hierarchy for. For now, I have been doing this manually by observing the data

acceptable hierarchies.</p>
<p>This seems like a task that can be automated. <strong>Does anyone know if there is
an algorithm to generate a concept hierarchy for numerical data?</strong></p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Maybe you need a clustering algorithm?</p>
<p>Quoting from the link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cluster analysis or clustering is the assignment of a set of observations
into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are
similar in some sense. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and
a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Jenks Natural Breaks is a very efficient single dimension clustering scheme:
http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/OUTPUT/html/Univariateclassificationschemes.html#_Ref116892931</p>
<p>As comments have noted, this is very similar to k-means. However, I've found
it even easier to implement, particularly the variation found in Borden Dent's
Cartography: http://www.amazon.com/Cartography-Thematic-Borden-D-

    <p>I'm trying to figure out if there is any existing AI tools/frameworks/Library
for Objective C or Cocos [well OpenGL + Obj C] in general that's good for a
person who's never done any form of AI before [other than the simple checkers
or tic-tac-toe AI's]. The scenario here is I've finished the basics control of
a game for the iPad and works fine for multi-player. The AI just needs to move
around, similar to the classic game snakes and somehow 'trap' a human player.
I now want to write an AI for this.</p>
<p>I found a thing called http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/ which appears to be
pretty good, however it was last updated in 2004. Which was 7 years ago, and
not sure if I should use it if there are other ones.</p>
<p>If anyone have any other suggestions of things I should look at, please guide
me to the right area.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Ai is usually very game specific and very hard to wrap in a reusable "Plug and
play" sort of system. The AI libraries that do exist contain common things
such as some mathematics, prediction, flocking, and path finding. I don't know
of any libraries in Objective-C that cover this, but your game sounds like it
would not really benefit from these because your AI requirements are fairly
simple.</p>
<p>The best way may be to write your own AI from scratch. Start by breaking down
the thought process for your AI into some kind of state machine (Make trees on
paper, list steps, etc) and write it step by step.</p>
<p>Ai is not a fast moving field like graphics. Something from 2004 in terms of
AI should still be very relevant. I would take a look at that library you
talked about as well.</p>
<p>Here is an example in Objective-C on A* pathfinding:</p>
<p>http://humblebeesoft.com/blog/?p=18</p>
<p>Make a post on the Gamedev AI:</p>
<p>http://www.gamedev.net/forum/9-artificial-intelligence/</p>
<p>I strongly recommend reading this AI book:</p>
<p>http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Game-Example-Mat-Buckland/dp/1556220782</p>
<p>This book will teach you how to think through the AI process and will teach
you how to write several systems that could become a part of an Ai framework.</p>

    <p>I'm writing a chess engine and recently added a transposition table.</p>
<p>When running a few tests, I found that although the search still returned the
same best move, the value of the move (how good it is for the maximizing
player) fluctuated.</p>
<p>Is this normal behavior for a transposition table? I remember reading that a
transposition table can cause search instability. Is this what that means? So
is this a normal occurrence or a serious bug in my code?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Yes, transposition tables introduce search instability.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it occurs rarely enough that the advantages of transposition
tables outweigh that complication by far.</p>
<p><strong>1. What is the function of a transposition table?</strong></p>
<p>After adding transposition tables (TT) to your program, you should notice two
main differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improve move ordering: The move from TT is generally the best possible move</li>
<li>Early cutoffs: When you reach a position again, which has been already searched with a greater distance, you can stop and use the value stored in the TT entry</li>
</ol>
<p>In chess, the improved move ordering is the most important factor. Only in
endgames, the likelihood of transposition increased, and you will see more
early cutoffs.</p>
<p>So, what does search instability mean? It means that when you search one
position with a given distance and later repeat the same search (same
position, same distance), you will get the identical result.</p>
<p><strong>2. Simple minimax/alpha beta search algorthm</strong></p>
<p>Let us first ignore search extension and start with a simple minimax or alpha-
beta search.</p>
<p>Note that you search will have the property that searches are repeatable, and
will see no search instabilities. Even if you improve your move ordering with
a move from a transposition table, you will still get the same result for
every search. However, after adding TT, the extra cutoffs from a deeper search
will in general break that property and introduce instabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, consider a position containing a deep tactic:</p>
<ul>
<li>A search with a low distance may not see it, but a search with a greater distance will.</li>
<li>After that result is stored in the TT, a re-search with the low distance will see the tactic, too. It now behaves differently compared to the original search.</li>
<li>Even worse, when the TT entry is overwritten, the improved knowledge gets lots again.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, using extra knowledge to force early cutoffs is a factor that leads to
instability. (But in practice, it is worth it, as it is more a theoretical
problem.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Search extensions</strong></p>
<p>When applied to a simple alpha beta search, the improved move ordering itself
does not lead to search instabilities. The situation is more complicated in
real-world search algorithms which implement many extensions. Some of these
extensions are sensitive to the move ordering, too.</p>
<p>One prominent example is called Late Move Reduction (LMR). It uses the fact,
that the quality of move ordering is generally so high that only the first few
moves have to be searched thoroughly, while the other moves are most likely
bad ones and will only be searched with a reduced distance.</p>
<p>LMR is only one example where move ordering makes search less repeatable. But
again, the advantages predominate.</p>
<p><strong>4. How much search instability is normal?</strong></p>
<p>There is no clear answer. In practice, you cannot eliminate instabilities
completely but if the instability gets out of control, your search will become
inefficient.</p>
<p>Of course, bugs can be the reason behind instabilities, too. So, is it a bug
in your search? Well, I don't know. Could be. :-)</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So is this a normal occurrence or a serious bug in my code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Schaeffer's advice (under "Plan Of Attack"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you initially restrict a TT lookup to be valid only if the table depth
exactly matches the depth that you need, then the TT will not change the
result of a fixed-depth alpha-beta search. It should, however, reduce the
number of nodes searched. Verify that this is working correctly.</p>
<p>Add in iterative deepening and move ordering. If you do this right, it
should not change the final result of the search but, again, it should
reduce the number of nodes searched.</p>
<p>Only when you are sure all the above is 100% working should you move on to
more search enhancements and a better evaluation function.</p>
