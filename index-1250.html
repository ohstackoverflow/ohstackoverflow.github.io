    <p>Is using sessions in a RESTful API really violating RESTfulness? I have seen
many opinions going either direction, but I'm not convinced that sessions are
<em>RESTless</em>. From my point of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>authentication is not prohibited for RESTfulness (otherwise there'd be little use in RESTful services)</li>
<li>authentication is done by sending an authentication token in the request, usually the header</li>
<li>this authentication token needs to be obtained somehow and may be revoked, in which case it needs to be renewed</li>
<li>the authentication token needs to be validated by the server (otherwise it wouldn't be authentication)</li>
</ul>
<p>So how do sessions violate this?</p>
<ul>
<li>client-side, sessions are realized using cookies</li>
<li>cookies are simply an extra HTTP header</li>
<li>a session cookie can be obtained and revoked at any time</li>
<li>session cookies can have an infinite life time if need be</li>
<li>the session id (authentication token) is validated server-side</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, to the client, a session cookie is exactly the same as any other HTTP
header based authentication mechanism, except that it uses the <code>Cookie</code> header
instead of the <code>Authorization</code> or some other proprietary header. If there was
no session attached to the cookie value server-side, why would that make a
difference? The server side implementation does not need to concern the client
as long as the server <em>behaves</em> RESTful. As such, cookies by themselves should
not make an API <em>RESTless</em> , and sessions are simply cookies to the client.</p>
<p>Are my assumptions wrong? What makes session cookies <em>RESTless</em>?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>First, let's define some terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>RESTful:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One can characterise applications conforming to the REST constraints
described in this section as "RESTful".[15] If a service violates any of the
required constraints, it cannot be considered RESTful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>according to wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>stateless constraint:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We next add a constraint to the client-server interaction: communication
must be stateless in nature, as in the client-stateless-server (CSS) style
of Section 3.4.3 (Figure 5-3), such that each request from client to server
must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and
cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is
therefore kept entirely on the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>according to the Fielding dissertation.</p>
<p>So server side sessions violate the stateless constraint of REST, and so
RESTfulness either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As such, to the client, a session cookie is exactly the same as any other
HTTP header based authentication mechanism, except that it uses the Cookie
header instead of the Authorization or some other proprietary header.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By session cookies you store the client state on the server and so your
request has a context. Let's try to add a load balancer and another service
instance to your system. In this case you have to share the sessions between
the service instances. It is hard to maintain and extend such a system, so it
scales badly...</p>
<p>In my opinion there is nothing wrong with cookies. The cookie technology is a
client side storing mechanism in where the stored data is attached
automatically to cookie headers by every request. I don't know of a REST
constraint which has problem with that kind of technology. So there is no
problem with the technology itself, the problem is with its usage. Fielding
wrote a sub-section about why he thinks HTTP cookies are bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my point of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>authentication is not prohibited for RESTfulness (otherwise there'd be
little use in RESTful services)</li>
<li>authentication is done by sending an authentication token in the
request, usually the header</li>
<li>this authentication token needs to be obtained somehow and may be
revoked, in which case it needs to be renewed</li>
<li>the authentication token needs to be validated by the server (otherwise
it wouldn't be authentication)
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Your point of view was pretty solid. The only problem was with the concept of
creating authentication token on the server. You don't need that part. What
you need is storing username and password on the client and send it with every
request. You don't need more to do this than HTTP basic auth and an encrypted
connection:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. - Stateless authentication by trusted clients" src="images/9kiTW.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Figure 1. - Stateless authentication by trusted clients</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably need an in-memory auth cache on server side to make things
faster, since you have to authenticate every request.</p>
<p>Now this works pretty well by trusted clients written by you, but what about
3rd party clients? They cannot have the username and password and all the
permissions of the users. So you have to store separately what permissions a
3rd party client can have by a specific user. So the client developers can
register they 3rd party clients, and get an unique API key and the users can
allow 3rd party clients to access some part of their permissions. Like reading
the name and email address, or listing their friends, etc... After allowing a
3rd party client the server will generate an access token. These access token
can be used by the 3rd party client to access the permissions granted by the
user, like so:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. - Stateless authentication by 3rd party
clients" src="images/HeG0r.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Figure 2. - Stateless authentication by 3rd party clients</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So the 3rd party client can get the access token from a trusted client (or
directly from the user). After that it can send a valid request with the API
key and access token. This is the most basic 3rd party auth mechanism. You can
read more about the implementation details in the documentation of every 3rd
party auth system, e.g. OAuth. Of course this can be more complex and more
secure, for example you can sign the details of every single request on server
side and send the signature along with the request, and so on... The actual
solution depends on your application's need.</p>

<p>I'm implementing the new Google Cloud Messaging following the guides from the
Google Developers page here</p>
<p>I've successfully run and test it. But my problem now is I have different
product flavors with different applicationId/packageName and different Google
Cloud Messaging Project Id. The <code>google-services.json</code> have to be put at the
<code>/app/google-services.json</code> not the flavors folder.</p>
<p>Is there any way to make the <code>google-services.json</code> config different for many
flavors?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Google included support for flavors in version 2.0 of the play services
plugin. Since this version of the <code>gradle plugin com.google.gms:google-
services:2.0.0-alpha3</code></p>
<p>you can do this</p>
<p>Step 1: add to gradle</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">// To auto-generate google map api key of google-services.json</span>
<span class="n">implementation</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:17.0.0'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Step 2: add to AndroidManifest.xml in the application tag</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">meta</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">data</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nl">android</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nl">android</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">"@string/google_api_key"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Step 3: download each flavor JSON file from firebase and add it</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">app/src/
    flavor1/google-services.json
    flavor2/google-services.json
</pre></div>

<p>Version 3.0.0 of the plugin searches for the JSON file in these locations
(considering you have a <code>flavor</code> flavor1 and a build type <code>debug</code>):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">/app/src/debug/google-services.json
/app/src/debug/flavor1/google-services.json
/app/google-services.json
</pre></div>

<p>This worked for me even using flavorDimensions. I have free &amp; paid in one
dimension and Mock &amp; Prod in the other dimension. I also have 3 buildTypes:
debug, release, and staging. This is how it looks in my project for the
FreeProd flavor:</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="images/yekEo.png"></p>
<p>How many google-services.json files will depend on your project's
characteristics, but you will need at least one JSON file for every Google
project.</p>

services/issues/54#issuecomment-165824720</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>echoing @HYRY, see the new docs in 0.11</p>
<p>http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html</p>
<p>Here we have new operators, <code>.iloc</code> to explicity support only integer
indexing, and <code>.loc</code> to explicity support only label indexing</p>

<p><code>[]</code> slices the rows (by label location) only</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<h4>The primary purpose of the DataFrame indexing operator, <code>[]</code> is to select</h4>
<p>columns.</p>
<p>When the indexing operator is passed a string or integer, it attempts to find
a column with that particular name and return it as a Series.</p>
<p>So, in the question above: <code>df[2]</code> searches for a column name matching the
integer value <code>2</code>. This column does not exist and a <code>KeyError</code> is raised.</p>
<hr>
<h4>The DataFrame indexing operator completely changes behavior to select rows</h4>
<p>when slice notation is used</p>
<p>Strangely, when given a slice, the DataFrame indexing operator selects rows
and can do so by integer location or by index label.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">df[2:3]
</pre></div>

<p>This will slice beginning from the row with integer location 2 up to 3,
exclusive of the last element. So, just a single row. The following selects
rows beginning at integer location 6 up to but not including 20 by every third
row.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">df[6:20:3]
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use slices consisting of string labels if your DataFrame index
has strings in it. For more details, see this solution on .iloc vs .loc.</p>
<p>I almost never use this slice notation with the indexing operator as its not
explicit and hardly ever used. When slicing by rows, stick with <code>.loc/.iloc</code>.</p>
