    <p>I know how I use these terms, but I'm wondering if there are accepted
definitions for <strong>faking</strong> , <strong>mocking</strong> , and <strong>stubbing</strong> for unit tests?
How do you define these for your tests? Describe situations where you might
use each.</p>
<p>Here is how I use them:</p>
<p><strong>Fake</strong> : a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no
logic. Simply returns "good" or "bad" data depending on the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Mock</strong> : a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to
dynamically set the values to return/exceptions to throw from particular
methods and provides the ability to check if particular methods have been
called/not called.</p>
<p><strong>Stub</strong> : Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to
verify that methods have been called/not called.</p>
<p>Mocks and stubs can be hand generated or generated by a mocking framework.
Fake classes are generated by hand. I use mocks primarily to verify
interactions between my class and dependent classes. I use stubs once I have
verified the interactions and am testing alternate paths through my code. I
use fake classes primarily to abstract out data dependencies or when
mocks/stubs are too tedious to set up each time.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You can get some information :</p>
<h3>From Martin Fowler about Mock and Stub</h3>
<p><strong>Fake</strong> objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some
shortcut which makes them not suitable for production</p>
<p><strong>Stubs</strong> provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not
responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs
may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that
remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'.</p>
<p><strong>Mocks</strong> are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with
expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to
receive.</p>
<h3>From xunitpattern:</h3>
<p><strong>Fake</strong> : We acquire or build a very lightweight implementation of the same
functionality as provided by a component that the SUT depends on and instruct
the SUT to use it instead of the real.</p>
<p><strong>Stub</strong> : This implementation is configured to respond to calls from the SUT
with the values (or exceptions) that will exercise the Untested Code (see
Production Bugs on page X) within the SUT. A key indication for using a Test
Stub is having Untested Code caused by the inability to control the indirect
inputs of the SUT</p>
<p><strong>Mock Object</strong> that implements the same interface as an object on which the
SUT (System Under Test) depends. We can use a Mock Object as an observation
point when we need to do Behavior Verification to avoid having an Untested
Requirement (see Production Bugs on page X) caused by an inability to observe
side-effects of invoking methods on the SUT.</p>
<h3>Personally</h3>
<p>I try to simplify by using : Mock and Stub. I use Mock when it's an object
that returns a value that is set to the tested class. I use Stub to mimic an
Interface or Abstract class to be tested. In fact, it doesn't really matter
what you call it, they are all classes that aren't used in production, and are
used as utility classes for testing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Stub</strong> - an object that provides predefined answers to method calls.</p>
<p><strong>Mock</strong> - an object on which you set expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Fake</strong> - an object with limited capabilities (for the purposes of testing),
e.g. a fake web service.</p>
<p>Test Double is the general term for stubs, mocks and fakes. But informally,
you'll often hear people simply call them mocks.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>the most easiest solution i found is.. to create a class with static data
members with getters setters.</p>
<p>set from one activity and get from another activity that object.</p>
<p>activity A</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">mytestclass.staticfunctionSet("","",""..etc.);

<p>activity b</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">mytestclass obj= mytestclass.staticfunctionGet();

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You'll need to serialize your object into some kind of string representation.
One possible string representation is JSON, and one of the easiest ways to
serialize to/from JSON in android, if you ask me, is through Google GSON.</p>
<p>In that case you just put the string return value from <code>(new
Gson()).toJson(myObject);</code> and retrieve the string value and use <code>fromJson</code> to
turn it back into your object.</p>
<p>If your object isn't very complex, however, it might not be worth the
overhead, and you could consider passing the separate values of the object
instead.</p>

    <p>Does C# have extension properties?</p>
<p>For example, can I add an extension property to <code>DateTimeFormatInfo</code> called
<code>ShortDateLongTimeFormat</code> which would return <code>ShortDatePattern + " " +
LongTimePattern</code>?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>For the moment it is still not supported out of the box by Roslyn compiler</h4>
<p>...</p>
<p>Until now, the extension properties were not seen as valuable enough to be
included in the previous versions of C# standard. Various <strong>C#</strong> versions
(maybe all of them?) have seen this as proposal champion but it wasn't
released yet, most of all because even if there is already an implementation,
they want to make it right.</p>
<h4>But it will maybe... one day ...</h4>
<p><em><strong>Update 2022:</strong></em></p>
<p>The features seems to be still in discussion <strong>here</strong>.</p>
<h4>Moreover you can use a workaround</h4>
<p>As specified in this article, you can use the <code>TypeDescriptor</code> capability to
attach an attribute to an object instance at runtime. However, it is not using
the syntax of the standard properties.<br>
It's a little bit different from just syntactic sugar adding a possibility to
define an extended property like<br><code>string Data(this MyClass instance)</code> as an alias for extension method<br><code>string GetData(this MyClass instance)</code> as it stores data into the class.</p>
<p>I hope that C# will soon provide a full featured extension everything
(properties and fields), however on that point, only time will tell.</p>
<p>And feel free to contribute as the software of tomorrow will come from the
community.</p>
<h4>Post processing approach</h4>
<p>If you are allowed to do so, you could also add dynamically a property on a
class in your assembly after compilation with tools like <em><strong>PostSharp</strong></em> ,
<em><strong>Mono.Cecil</strong></em> (or similar code/IL rewrite tool).</p>
<p>However, as a developer explained in the <strong>above discussion</strong> , rewriting code
won't let the compiler knows your intent and thus it will probably fail at
optimizing your resulting code. As a language feature, the result is expected
to be better.</p>
<h4>A bit of history</h4>
<p>There was an <strong>extension members</strong> item in the <strong>C# 7 work list</strong> so I thought
it might be supported in the near future. The current status of extension
property can be found on Github under the related item.</p>
<p>However, there is an even more promising topic which is the "extend
everything" with a focus on especially properties and static classes or even
fields.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: August 2016</strong></em></p>
<p>As dotnet team published what's new in C# 7.0 and from a comment of Mads
Torgensen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extension properties: we had a (brilliant!) intern implement them over the
summer as an experiment, along with other kinds of extension members. We
remain interested in this, but it’s a big change and we need to feel
confident that it’s worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that extension properties and other members, are still good
candidates to be included in a future release of Roslyn, but maybe not the 7.0
one.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: May 2017</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The extension members</strong> has been closed as duplicate of <strong>extension
everything issue</strong> which is closed too. The main discussion was in fact about
Type extensibility in a broad sense. The feature is now tracked <strong>here as a
proposal</strong> and has been removed from <strong>7.0 milestone</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: August, 2017 - C# 8.0 proposed feature</strong></em></p>
<p>While it still remains only a <em>proposed</em> feature, we have now a clearer view
of what would be its syntax. Keep in mind that this will be the new syntax for
extension methods as well:</p>

<p>Similar to partial classes, but compiled as a separate class/type in a
different assembly. Note you will also be able to add static members and
operators this way. As mentioned in Mads Torgensen podcast, <em><strong>the extension
won't have any state (so it cannot add private instance members to the class)
which means you won't be able to add private instance data linked to the
instance</strong></em>. The reason invoked for that is it would imply to manage
internally dictionaries and it could be difficult (memory management, etc...).
For this, you can still use the <code>TypeDescriptor</code>/<code>ConditionalWeakTable</code>
technique described earlier and with the property extension, hides it under a
nice property.</p>
<p>Syntax is still subject to change as implies this issue. For example,
<code>extends</code> could be replaced by <code>for</code> which some may feel more natural and less
java related.</p>
<p><strong>Update December 2018 - Roles, Extensions and static interface members</strong></p>
<p><em>Extension everything</em> didn't make it to C# 8.0, because of some of drawbacks
explained as the end of this GitHub ticket. So, there was an exploration to
improve the design. Here, Mads Torgensen explains what are <strong>roles and
extensions</strong> and how they differs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roles allow interfaces to be implemented on specific values of a given type.
Extensions allow interfaces to be implemented on all values of a given type,
within a specific region of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen at a split of previous proposal in two use cases. The <strong>new
syntax for extension</strong> would be like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">extension</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ULongEnumerable</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ulong</span>
{
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">IEnumerator</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">byte</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">GetEnumerator</span><span class="ss">()</span>
<span class="w">    </span>{
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sizeof</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">ulong</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">; i &gt; 0; i--)</span>
<span class="w">        </span>{
<span class="w">            </span><span class="nv">yield</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">unchecked</span><span class="ss">((</span><span class="nv">byte</span><span class="ss">)(</span><span class="nv">this</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="ss">))</span><span class="c1">;</span>
<span class="w">        </span>}
<span class="w">    </span>}
}
</pre></div>

<p>then you would be able to do this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">foreach</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">byte</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">0x_3A_9E_F1_C5_DA_F7_30_16ul</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="err">WriteLine($"{e.</span><span class="n">Current</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="err">"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And for a <strong>static interface</strong> :</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public interface IMonoid&lt;T&gt; where T : IMonoid&lt;T&gt;
{
    static T operator +(T t1, T t2);
    static T Zero { get; }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Add an <strong>extension property</strong> on <code>int</code> and treat the <code>int</code> as <code>IMonoid&lt;int&gt;</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public extension IntMonoid of int : IMonoid&lt;int&gt;
{
    public static int Zero =&gt; 0;
}
</pre></div>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>No they do not exist in C# 3.0 and will not be added in 4.0. It's on the list
of feature wants for C# so it may be added at a future date.</p>
<p>At this point the best you can do is GetXXX style extension methods.</p>
