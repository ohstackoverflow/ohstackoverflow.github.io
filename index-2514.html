    <p>In CSS3 <code>font-face</code>, there are multiple font types included like <code>ttf</code>, <code>eot</code>,
<code>woff</code>, <code>svg</code> and <code>cff</code>.</p>
<p>Why should we use all of these types?</p>
<p>If they are special to different browsers, why is the number of them greater
than the number of the major web browsers?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>Answer in 2019:</h4>
<p>Only use WOFF2, or if you need legacy support, WOFF. Do not use any other
format</p>
<p>(<code>svg</code> and <code>eot</code> are dead formats, <code>ttf</code> and <code>otf</code> are full system fonts, and
should not be used for web purposes)</p>
<h4>Original answer from 2012:</h4>
<p>In short, font-face is very old, but only recently has been supported by more
than IE.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>eot</code> is needed for Internet Explorers that are older than IE9 - they invented the spec, but eot was a proprietary solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ttf</code> and <code>otf</code> are normal old fonts, so some people got annoyed that this meant anyone could download expensive-to-license fonts for free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time passes, SVG 1.1 adds a "fonts" chapter that explains how to model a font purely using SVG markup, and people start to use it. More time passes and it turns out that they are <em>absolutely terrible</em> compared to just a normal font format, and SVG 2 wisely removes the entire chapter again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, <code>woff</code> gets invented by people with quite a bit of domain knowledge, which makes it possible to host fonts in a way that throws away bits that are critically important for system installation, but irrelevant for the web (making people worried about piracy happy) and allows for internal compression to better suit the needs of the web (making users and hosts happy). This becomes the preferred format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2019 edit</strong> A few years later, <code>woff2</code> gets drafted and accepted, which improves the compression, leading to even smaller files, along with the ability to load a single font "in parts" so that a font that supports 20 scripts can be stored as "chunks" on disk instead, with browsers automatically able to load the font "in parts" as needed, rather than needing to transfer the entire font up front, further improving the typesetting experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't want to support IE 8 and lower, and iOS 4 and lower, and android
4.3 or earlier, then you can just use WOFF (and WOFF2, a more highly
compressed WOFF, for the newest browsers that support it.)</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Woff is a compressed (zipped) form of the TrueType - OpenType font. It is
small and can be delivered over the network like a graphic file. Most
importantly, this way the font is preserved completely including rendering
rule tables that very few people care about because they use only Latin
script.</p>
<p>Take a look at [dead URL removed]. The font you see is an experimental web
delivered smartfont (woff) that has thousands of combined characters making
complex shapes. The underlying text is simple Latin code of romanized
Singhala. (Copy and paste to Notepad and see).</p>
<p>Only woff can do this because nobody has this font and yet it is seen anywhere
(Mac, Win, Linux and even on smartphones by all browsers except by IE. IE does
not have full support for Open Types).</p>

    <p>What's the "Bad magic number" ImportError in python, and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>The only thing I can find online suggests this is caused by compiling a .py -&gt;
.pyc file and then trying to use it with the wrong version of python. In my
case, however, the file seems to import fine some times but not others, and
I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>The information python's providing in the traceback isn't particularly helpful
(which is why I was asking here...), but here it is in case it helps:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>

<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The magic number comes from UNIX-type systems where the first few bytes of a
file held a marker indicating the file type.</p>
<p>Python puts a similar marker into its <code>pyc</code> files when it creates them.</p>
<p>Then the python interpreter makes sure this number is correct when loading it.</p>
<p>Anything that damages this magic number will cause your problem. This includes
editing the <code>pyc</code> file or trying to run a <code>pyc</code> from a different version of
python (usually later) than your interpreter.</p>
<p>If they are <em>your</em> <code>pyc</code> files, just delete them and let the interpreter re-
compile the <code>py</code> files. On UNIX type systems, that could be something as
simple as:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">rm *.pyc
</pre></div>

<p>or:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
</pre></div>

<p>If they are not yours, you'll have to either get the <code>py</code> files for re-
compilation, or an interpreter that can run the <code>pyc</code> files with that
particular magic value.</p>
<p>One thing that might be causing the intermittent nature. The <code>pyc</code> that's
causing the problem may only be imported under certain conditions. It's highly
unlikely it would import sometimes. You should check the actual full stack
trace when the import fails?</p>
<p>As an aside, the first word of all my <code>2.5.1(r251:54863)</code> <code>pyc</code> files is
<code>62131</code>, <code>2.6.1(r261:67517)</code> is <code>62161</code>. The list of all magic numbers can be
found in <code>Python/import.c</code>, reproduced here for completeness (current as at
the time the answer was posted, it may have changed since then):</p>

    <p>What is the difference between <strong>JVM</strong> , <strong>JDK</strong> , <strong>JRE</strong> &amp; <strong>OpenJDK</strong>?</p>
<p>I was programming in Java and I encountered these phrases, what are the
differences among them?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2>JVM</h2>
<p>The <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong> (JVM) is the virtual machine that runs the Java
bytecodes. The JVM doesn't understand Java source code; that's why you need
compile your <code>*.java</code> files to obtain <code>*.class</code> files that contain the
bytecodes understood by the JVM. It's also the entity that allows Java to be a
"portable language" ( <em>write once, run anywhere</em> ). Indeed, there are specific
implementations of the JVM for different systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, see
the Wikipedia list), the aim is that with the same bytecodes they all give the
same results.</p>
<h2>JDK and JRE</h2>
<p>To explain the difference between JDK and JRE, the best is to read the Oracle
documentation and consult the diagram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong></p>
<p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual
Machine, and other components to run applets and applications written in the
Java programming language. In addition, two key deployment technologies are
part of the JRE: Java Plug-in, which enables applets to run in popular
browsers; and Java Web Start, which deploys standalone applications over a
network. It is also the foundation for the technologies in the Java 2
Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) for enterprise software development and
deployment. The JRE does not contain tools and utilities such as compilers
or debuggers for developing applets and applications.</p>
<p><strong>Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong></p>
<p>The JDK is a superset of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the
JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing
applets and applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Oracle is not the only one to provide JDKs.</p>
<h2>OpenJDK</h2>
<p><strong>OpenJDK</strong> is an open-source implementation of the JDK and the base for the
Oracle JDK. There is almost no difference between the Oracle JDK and the
OpenJDK.</p>
<p>The differences are stated in this blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the difference between the source code found in the OpenJDK
repository, and the code you use to build the Oracle JDK?</p>
<p>A: It is very close - our build process for Oracle JDK releases builds on
OpenJDK 7 by adding just a couple of pieces, like the deployment code, which
includes Oracle's implementation of the Java Plugin and Java WebStart, as
well as some closed source third party components like a graphics
rasterizer, some open source third party components, like Rhino, and a few
bits and pieces here and there, like additional documentation or third party
fonts. Moving forward, our intent is to open source all pieces of the Oracle
JDK except those that we consider commercial features such as JRockit
Mission Control (not yet available in Oracle JDK), and replace encumbered
third party components with open source alternatives to achieve closer
parity between the code bases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Update for JDK 11</h2>
<p>An article from Donald Smith try to disambiguate the difference between Oracle
JDK and Oracle's OpenJDK : https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-
group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later</p>
<p>As mentioned in comments by @Alan Evangelista, Java Web Start has been
deprecated by Oracle in Java SE 9 and removed in Java SE 11.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>JVM is the Java Virtual Machine – it actually runs Java ByteCode.</p>
<p>JRE is the Java Runtime Environment – it contains a JVM, among other things,
and is what you need to run a Java program.</p>
<p>JDK is the Java Development Kit – it is the JRE, but with javac (which is what
you need to compile Java source code) and other programming tools added.</p>
<p>OpenJDK is a specific JDK implementation.</p>
