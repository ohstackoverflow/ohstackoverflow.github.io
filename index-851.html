    <p>When would I use SNS versus SQS, and why are they always coupled together?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>SNS</strong> is a distributed <strong>publish-subscribe</strong> system. Messages are <strong>pushed</strong>
to subscribers as and when they are sent by publishers to SNS.</p>
<p><strong>SQS</strong> is distributed <strong>queuing</strong> system. Messages are <em>not</em> pushed to
receivers. Receivers have to <strong>poll or pull</strong> messages from <strong>SQS</strong>. Messages
can't be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any one receiver can
receive a message, process and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the
same message later. Polling inherently introduces some latency in message
delivery in SQS unlike SNS where messages are immediately pushed to
subscribers. SNS supports several end points such as email, SMS, HTTP end
point and SQS. If you want unknown number and type of subscribers to receive
messages, you need SNS.</p>
<p>You don't have to couple SNS and SQS always. You can have SNS send messages to
email, SMS or HTTP end point apart from SQS. There are advantages to coupling
SNS with SQS. You may not want an external service to make connections to your
hosts (a firewall may block all incoming connections to your host from
outside).</p>
<p>Your end point may just die because of heavy volume of messages. Email and SMS
maybe not your choice of processing messages quickly. By coupling SNS with
SQS, you can receive messages at your pace. It allows clients to be offline,
tolerant to network and host failures. You also achieve guaranteed delivery.
If you configure SNS to send messages to an HTTP end point or email or SMS,
several failures to send message may result in messages being dropped.</p>
<p>SQS is mainly used to decouple applications or integrate applications.
Messages can be stored in SQS for a short duration of time (maximum 14 days).
SNS distributes several copies of messages to several subscribers. For
example, let’s say you want to replicate data generated by an application to
several storage systems. You could use SNS and send this data to multiple
subscribers, each replicating the messages it receives to different storage
systems (S3, hard disk on your host, database, etc.).</p>

    <p>In Vim, what is the command to correct the indentation of all the lines?</p>
<p>Often times I'll copy and paste code into a remote terminal and have the whole
thing messed up. I want to fix this in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><code>=</code>, the indent command can take motions. So, <code>gg</code> to get the start of the
file, <code>=</code> to indent, <code>G</code> to the end of the file, <code>gg=G</code>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Before pasting into the terminal, try <code>:set paste</code> and then <code>:set nopaste</code>
after you're done. This will turn off the auto-indent, line-wrap and other
features that are messing up your paste.</p>
<p>edit: Also, I should point out that a much better result than <code>=</code> indenting
can usually be obtained by using an external program. For example, I run
<code>:%!perltidy</code> all the time. <code>astyle</code>, <code>cindent</code>, etc. can also be used. And,
of course, you can map those to a key stroke, and map different ones to the
same keystroke depending on file type.</p>

    <p>I'd like to paste yanked text into Vim's command line. Is it possible?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Yes. Hit <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code> then <code>"</code>. If you have literal control characters in what
you have yanked, use <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code>, <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>O</code>, <code>"</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of what you can do with registers. What you can do with
registers is extraordinary, and once you know how to use them you cannot live
without them.</p>
<p>Registers are basically storage locations for strings. Vim has many registers
that work in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>0</code> (yank register: when you use <code>y</code> in normal mode, without specifying a register, yanked text goes there and also to the default register),</li>
<li>
<code>1</code> to <code>9</code> (shifting delete registers, when you use commands such as <code>c</code> or <code>d</code>, what has been deleted goes to register 1, what was in register 1 goes to register 2, <em>etc.</em> ),</li>
<li>
<code>"</code> (default register, also known as unnamed register. This is where the <code>"</code> comes in <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code>, <code>"</code>),</li>
<li>
<code>a</code> to <code>z</code> for your own use (capitalized <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code> are for appending to corresponding registers).</li>
<li>
<code>_</code> (acts like <code>/dev/null</code> (Unix) or <code>NUL</code> (Windows), you can write to it but it's discarded and when you read from it, it is always empty),</li>
<li>
<code>-</code> (small delete register),</li>
<li>
<code>/</code> (search pattern register, updated when you look for text with <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>*</code> or <code>#</code> for instance; you can also write to it to dynamically change the search pattern),</li>
<li>
<code>:</code> (stores last VimL typed command via <code>Q</code> or <code>:</code>, readonly),</li>
<li>
<code>+</code> and <code>*</code> (system clipboard registers, you can write to them to set the clipboard and read the clipboard contents from them)</li>
</ul>
<p>See <code>:help registers</code> for the full reference.</p>
<p>You can, at any moment, use <code>:registers</code> to display the contents of all
registers. Synonyms and shorthands for this command are <code>:display</code>, <code>:reg</code> and
<code>:di</code>.</p>
<p>In Insert or Command-line mode, <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code> plus a register name, inserts the
contents of this register. If you want to insert them literally (no auto-
indenting, no conversion of control characters like <code>0x08</code> to backspace, etc),
you can use <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code>, <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>O</code>, register name. See <code>:help i_CTRL-R</code> and
following paragraphs for more reference.</p>
<p>But you can also do the following (and I probably forgot many uses for
registers).</p>
<ul>
<li>In normal mode, hit <code>"``:``p</code>. The last command you used in vim is pasted into your buffer.<br>
Let's decompose: <code>"</code> is a Normal mode command that lets you select what
register is to be used during the next yank, delete or paste operation. So
<code>"``:</code> selects the colon register (storing last command). Then <code>p</code> is a
command you already know, it pastes the contents of the register.</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help "</code>, <code>:help quote_:</code></p>
<ul>
<li>You're editing a VimL file (for instance your <code>.vimrc</code>) and would like to execute a couple of consecutive lines right now: <code>y``j``:``@``"``Enter</code>.<br>
Here, <code>y``j</code> yanks current and next line (this is because j is a linewise
motion but this is out of scope of this answer) into the default register
(also known as the unnamed register). Then the <code>:@</code> Ex command plays Ex
commands stored in the register given as argument, and <code>"</code> is how you refer to
the unnamed register. Also see the top of this answer, which is related.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not confuse <code>"</code> used here (which is a register name) with the <code>"</code> from the
previous example, which was a Normal-mode command.</p>
<p>cf. <code>:help :@</code> and <code>:help quote_quote</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Insert the last search pattern into your file in Insert mode, or into the command line, with <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code>, <code>/</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help quote_/</code>, <code>help i_CTRL-R</code></p>
<p>Corollary: Keep your search pattern but add an alternative: <code>/</code> <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code>,
<code>/</code> <code>\|alternative</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You've selected two words in the middle of a line in visual mode, yanked them with <code>y</code>, they are in the unnamed register. Now you want to open a new line just below where you are, with those two words: <code>:pu</code>. This is shorthand for <code>:put "</code>. The <code>:put</code> command, like many Ex commands, works only linewise.</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help :put</code></p>
<p>You could also have done: <code>:call setreg('"', @", 'V')</code> then <code>p</code>. The <code>setreg</code>
function sets the register of which the name is given as first argument (as a
string), initializes it with the contents of the second argument (and you can
use registers as variables with the name <code>@x</code> where <code>x</code> is the register name
in VimL), and turns it into the mode specified in the third argument, <code>V</code> for
linewise, nothing for characterwise and literal <code>^V</code> for blockwise.</p>
<p>cf. <code>:help setreg()</code>. The reverse functions are <code>getreg()</code> and <code>getregtype()</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have recorded a macro with <code>qa</code>...<code>q</code>, then <code>:echo @a</code> will tell you what you have typed, and <code>@a</code> will replay the macro (probably you knew that one, very useful in order to avoid repetitive tasks)</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help q</code>, <code>help @</code></p>
<p>Corollary from the previous example: If you have <code>8go</code> in the clipboard, then
<code>@+</code> will play the clipboard contents as a macro, and thus go to the 8th byte
of your file. Actually this will work with almost every register. If your last
inserted string was <code>dd</code> in Insert mode, then <code>@.</code> will (because the <code>.</code>
register contains the last inserted string) delete a line. (Vim documentation
is wrong in this regard, since it states that the registers <code>#</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>:</code> and
<code>.</code> will only work with <code>p</code>, <code>P</code>, <code>:put</code> and <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code>).</p>
<p>cf. <code>:help @</code></p>
<p>Don't confuse <code>:@</code> (command that plays Vim commands from a register) and <code>@</code>
(normal-mode command that plays normal-mode commands from a register).</p>
<p>Notable exception is <code>@:</code>. The command register does not contain the initial
colon neither does it contain the final carriage return. However in Normal
mode, <code>@:</code> will do what you expect, interpreting the register as an Ex
command, not trying to play it in Normal mode. So if your last command was
<code>:e</code>, the register contains <code>e</code> but <code>@:</code> will reload the file, not go to end
of word.</p>
<p>cf. <code>:help @:</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Show what you will be doing in Normal mode before running it: <code>@='dd'</code> <code>Enter</code>. As soon as you hit the <code>=</code> key, Vim switches to expression evaluation: as you enter an expression and hit <code>Enter</code>, Vim computes it, and the result acts as a register content. Of course the register <code>=</code> is read-only, and one-shot. Each time you start using it, you will have to enter a new expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help quote_=</code></p>
<p>Corollary: If you are editing a command, and you realize that you should need
to insert into your command line some line from your current buffer: don't
press <code>Esc</code>! Use <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code> <code>=getline(58)</code> <code>Enter</code>. After that you will be
back to command line editing, but it has inserted the contents of the 58th
line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a search pattern manually: <code>:let @/ = 'foo'</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help :let</code></p>
<p>Note that doing that, you needn't to escape <code>/</code> in the pattern. However you
need to double all single quotes of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy all lines beginning with <code>foo</code>, and afterwards all lines containing <code>bar</code> to clipboard, chain these commands: <code>qaq</code> (resets the <em>a</em> register storing an empty macro inside it), <code>:g/^foo/y A</code>, <code>:g/bar/y A</code>, <code>:let @+ = @a</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a capital register name makes the register work in append mode</p>
<p>Better, if <code>Q</code> has not been remapped by <code>mswin.vim</code>, start Ex mode with <code>Q</code>,
chain those “colon commands” which are actually better called “Ex commands”,
and go back to Normal mode by typing <code>visual</code>.</p>
<p>cf. <code>:help :g</code>, <code>:help :y</code>, <code>:help Q</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Double-space your file: <code>:g/^/put _</code>. This puts the contents of the black hole register (empty when reading, but writable, behaving like <code>/dev/null</code>) linewise, after each line (because every line has a beginning!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a line containing <code>foo</code> before each line: <code>:g/^/-put ='foo'</code>. This is a clever use of the expression register. Here, <code>-</code> is a synonym for <code>.-1</code> (cf. <code>:help :range</code>). Since <code>:put</code> puts the text after the line, you have to explicitly tell it to act on the previous one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the entire buffer to the system clipboard: <code>:%y+</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help :range</code> (for the <code>%</code> part) and <code>:help :y</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have misrecorded a macro, you can type <code>:let @a='</code> <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R</code> <code>=replace(@a,"'","''",'g')</code> <code>Enter</code> <code>'</code> and edit it. This will modify the contents of the macro stored in register <code>a</code>, and it's shown here how you can use the expression register to do that. Another, simpler, way of modifying a macro is to paste it in a buffer (<code>"ap</code>), edit it, and put it again into the register, by selecting it and <code>"ay</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you did <code>dddd</code>, you might do <code>uu</code> in order to undo. With <code>p</code> you could get the last deleted line. But actually you can also recover up to 9 deletes with the registers <code>@1</code> through <code>@9</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even better, if you do <code>"1P</code>, then <code>.</code> in Normal mode will play <code>"2P</code>, and so
on.</p>
<p>cf. <code>:help .</code> and <code>:help quote_number</code></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to insert the current date in Insert mode: <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>R``=strftime('%y%m%d')``Enter</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>cf. <code>:help strftime()</code></p>
<p>Once again, what can be confusing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>:@</code> is a command-line command that interprets the contents of a register as vimscript and sources it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@</code> in normal mode command that interprets the contents of a register as normal-mode keystrokes (except when you use <code>:</code> register, that contains last played command without the initial colon: in this case it replays the command as if you also re-typed the colon and the final return key).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>"</code> in normal mode command that helps you select a register for yank, paste, delete, correct, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>"</code> is also a valid register name (the default, or unnamed, register) and therefore can be passed as an arguments for commands that expect register names</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>For pasting something that is the system clipboard you can just use <code>SHIFT</code> -
<code>INS</code>.</p>
<p>It works in Windows, but I am guessing it works well in Linux too.</p>
