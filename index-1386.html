    <p>Can you explain me how to build the tree?</p>
<p>I quite understood how the nodes are chosen, but a nicer explanation would
really help me implementing this algorithm. I already have a board
representing the game state, but I don't know (understand) how to generate the
tree.</p>
<p>Can someone points me to a well commented implementation of the algorithm (I
need to use it for AI)? Or better explanation/examples of it?</p>
<p>I didn't found a lot of resources on the net, this algorithm is rather new...</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The best way to generate the tree is a series of random playouts. The trick is
being able to balance between exploration and exploitation (this is where the
UCT comes in). There are some good code samples and plenty of research paper
references here :
https://web.archive.org/web/20160308043415/http://mcts.ai:80/index.html</p>
<p>When I implemented the algorithm, I used random playouts until I hit an end
point or termination state. I had a static evaluation function that would
calculate the payoff at this point, then the score from this point is
propagated back up the tree. Each player or "team" assumes that the other team
will play the best move for themselves, and the worst move possible for their
opponent.</p>
<p>I would also recommend checking out the papers by Chaslot and his phd thesis
as well as some of the research that references his work (basically all the
MCTS work since then).</p>
<hr>
<p>For example: Player 1's first move could simulate 10 moves into the future
alternating between player 1 moves and player 2 moves. Each time you must
assume that the opposing player will try to minimize your score whilst
maximizing their own score. There is an entire field based on this known as
Game Theory. Once you simulate to the end of 10 games, you iterate from the
start point again (because there is no point only simulating one set of
decisions). Each of these branches of the tree must be scored where the score
is propagated up the tree and the score represents the best possible payoff
for the player doing the simulating assuming that the other player is also
choosing the best moves for themselves.</p>
<p>MCTS consists of four strategic steps, repeated as long as there is time left.
The steps are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the selection step the tree is traversed from the root node until we reach a node E, where we select a position that is not added to the tree yet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, during the play-out step moves are played in self-play until the end of the game is reached. The result R of this “simulated” game is +1 in case of a win for Black (the first player in LOA), 0 in case of a draw, and −1 in case of a win for White. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, in the expansion step children of E are added to the tree. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, R is propagated back along the path from E to the root node in the backpropagation step. When time is up, the move played by the program is the child of the root with the highest value. (This example is taken from this paper - PDF </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some implementations:</p>
<p>A list of libraries and games using some MCTS implementations
http://senseis.xmp.net/?MonteCarloTreeSearch</p>
<p>and a game independent open source UCT MCTS library called Fuego

    <p>I tried google and found little that I could understand.</p>
<p>I understand Markov chains to a very basic level: It's a mathematical model
that only depends on previous input to change states..so sort of a FSM with
weighted random chances instead of different criteria?</p>
<p>I've heard that you can use them to generate semi-intelligent nonsense, given
sentences of existing words to use as a dictionary of kinds.</p>
<p>I can't think of search terms to find this, so can anyone link me or explain
how I could produce something that gives a semi-intelligent answer? (if you
asked it about pie, it would not start going on about the vietnam war it had
heard about)</p>
<p>I plan on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having this bot idle in IRC channels for a bit</li>
<li>Strip any usernames out of the string and store as sentences or whatever</li>
<li>Over time, use this as the basis for the above.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Yes, a Markov chain is a finite-state machine with probabilistic state
transitions. To generate random text with a simple, first-order Markov chain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect bigram (adjacent word pair) statistics from a corpus (collection of text).</li>
<li>Make a markov chain with one state per word. Reserve a special state for end-of-text.</li>
<li>The probability of jumping from state/word <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> is the probability of the words <em>y</em> immediately following <em>x</em> , estimated from relative bigram frequencies in the training corpus.</li>
<li>Start with a random word <em>x</em> (perhaps determined by how often that word occurs as the first word of a sentence in the corpus). Then pick a state/word <em>y</em> to jump to randomly, taking into account the probability of <em>y</em> following <em>x</em> (the state transition probability). Repeat until you hit end-of-text.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to get something semi-intelligent out of this, then your best shot
is to train it on lots of carefully collected texts. The "lots" part makes it
produce proper sentences (or plausible IRC speak) with high probability; the
"carefully collected" part means you control what it talks about. Introducing
higher-order Markov chains also helps in both areas, but takes more storage to
store the necessary statistics. You may also look into things like statistical
smoothing.</p>
<p>However, having your IRC bot actually respond to what is said to it takes a
<em>lot</em> more than Markov chains. It may be done by doing text categorization
(aka topic spotting) on what is said, then picking a domain-specific Markov
chain for text generation. Naïve Bayes is a popular model for topic spotting.</p>
<p>Kernighan and Pike in <em>The Practice of Programming</em> explore various
implementation strategies for Markov chain algorithms. These, and natural
language generation in general, is covered in great depth by Jurafsky and
Martin, <em>Speech and Language Processing</em>.</p>

    <p>I'm planning to develop program in Java which will provide diagnosis. The data
set is divided into two parts one for training and the other for testing. My
program should learn to classify from the training data (BTW which contain
answer for 30 questions each in new column, each record in new line the last
column will be diagnosis 0 or 1, in the testing part of data diagnosis column
will be empty - data set contain about 1000 records) and then make predictions
in testing part of data :/</p>
<p>I've never done anything similar so I'll appreciate any advice or information
about solution to similar problem.</p>
<p>I was thinking about Java Machine Learning Library or Java Data Mining Package
but I'm not sure if it's right direction... ? and I'm still not sure how to
tackle this challenge...</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>All the best!</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Hi As Gann Bierner said, this is a classification problem. The best
classification algorithm for your needs I know of is, Ross Quinlan algorithm.
It's conceptually very easy to understand.</p>
<p>For off-the-shelf implementations of the classification algorithms, the best
bet is Weka. http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/. I have studied Weka but not
used, as I discovered it a little too late.</p>
<p>I used a much simpler implementation called JadTi. It works pretty good for
smaller data sets such as yours. I have used it quite a bit, so can
confidently tell so. JadTi can be found at:</p>
<p>http://www.run.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~francois/software/jaDTi/</p>
<p>Having said all that, your challenge will be building a usable interface over
web. To do so, the dataset will be of limited use. The data set basically
works on the premise that you have the training set already, and you feed the
new test dataset in one step, and you get the answer(s) immediately.</p>
<p>But my application, probably yours also, was a step by step user discovery,
with features to go back and forth on the decision tree nodes.</p>
<p>To build such an application, I created a PMML document from my training set,
and built a Java Engine that traverses each node of the tree asking the user
to give an input (text/radio/list) and use the values as inputs to the next
possible node predicate.</p>
<p>The PMML standard can be found here: http://www.dmg.org/ Here you need the
TreeModel only. NetBeans XML Plugin is a good schema-aware editor for PMML
authoring. Altova XML can do a better job, but costs $$.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use an RDBMS to store your dataset and create the PMML
automagically! I have not tried that.</p>
<p>Good luck with your project, please feel free to let me know if you need
further inputs.</p>
