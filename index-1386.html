    <p>When I read the book -- Artificial Intelligence (a modern approach), I came
across the following sentence describing the method to convert a n-ary
Constraint Search Problem to a binary one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another way to convert an n-ary CSP to a binary one is the dual graph
transformation: create a new graph in which there will be one variable for
each constraint in the original graph, and one binary constraint for each
pair of constraints in the original graph that share variables. For example,
if the original graph has variables {X, Y, Z} and constraints ⟨(X, Y, Z),
C1⟩ and ⟨(X, Y ), C2⟩ then the dual graph would have variables {C1, C2} with
the binary constraint ⟨(X, Y ), R1 ⟩, where (X, Y ) are the shared variables
and R1 is a new relation that defines the constraint between the shared
variables, as specified by the original C1 and C2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't quite get the example provided in the book, can anybody help to
explain it in another way and may better provide a concrete example? thanks :D</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Let's say your problem has the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>C1, which involves x, y and z: <ul>
<li>x + y = z </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C2, which involves x and y: <ul>
<li>x &lt; y</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>with the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>x :: [1,2,3]</li>
<li>y :: [1,2,3]</li>
<li>z :: [1,2,3]</li>
</ul>
<p>The author says that you need to create 2 more variables, one for each
constraint. They are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>c1 = &lt; x, y, z &gt;</li>
<li>c2 = &lt; x, y &gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>The domains of c1 and c2 are defined so that they don't violate C1 and C2,
i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li>c1 :: [ &lt;1,2,3&gt;, &lt;2,1,3&gt;, &lt;1,1,2&gt;]</li>
<li>c2 :: [&lt;1,2&gt;, &lt;2,3&gt;, &lt;1,3&gt;]</li>
</ul>
<p>c1 and c2 will be the nodes of the dual graph, but first you need to define a
constraint between them, i.e. R1:</p>
<ul>
<li>R1: "the 1st and the 2nd element of c1 (x and y) must be equal to the 1st and the 2nd element of c2 respectively" (actually you could split it in two simpler constraints)</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have taken an AI course, and the teacher asked us to implement a game that
makes use of one of the AI algorithms. Here is where I need a bit of help:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know to what kind of games each algorithm is applied</li>
<li>if you could just give an example of a game or game type and the algorithm it uses, I would appreciate it</li>

<p>I don't need any coding help, I can manage that (my language of choice is
Java). I only need a little help on selecting an algorithm.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In adjunct to Ben's answer, a good combo is alpha-beta pruning along with a
game like connect 4. The heuristic for something like tic-tac-toe is too
simple, and for chess, too complex. But connect 4 or a similiar "middle of the
road" game can be an excellent place to see how the heuristic makes a big
difference in both efficiency and quality, and it's also complex enough to
even get some "niche" heuristics that can win some scenarios over other,
generally better heuristics. The rules of connect 4 in particular are simple
enough that it's very easy to come up with your own successful heuristics to
see these things in action.</p>
<p>Another common AI to play with is A* for pathfinding, such as unit travel in
an RTS or sandbox environment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Alpha-beta pruning is a good one for game trees in general, and turn-based
games like chess and tic-tac-toe in particular.</p>

    <p>A developer I am working with is developing a program that analyzes images of
pavement to find cracks in the pavement. For every crack his program finds, it
produces an entry in a file that tells me which pixels make up that particular
crack. There are two problems with his software though:</p>
<p>1) It produces several false positives</p>
<p>2) If he finds a crack, he only finds small sections of it and denotes those
sections as being separate cracks.</p>
<p>My job is to write software that will read this data, analyze it, and tell the
difference between false-positives and actual cracks. I also need to determine
how to group together all the small sections of a crack as one.</p>
<p>I have tried various ways of filtering the data to eliminate false-positives,
and have been using neural networks to a limited degree of success to group
cracks together. I understand there will be error, but as of now, there is
just too much error. Does anyone have any insight for a non-AI expert as to
the best way to accomplish my task or learn more about it? What kinds of books
should I read, or what kind of classes should I take?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> My question is more about how to notice patterns in my coworker's
data and identify those patterns as actual cracks. It's the higher-level logic
that I'm concerned with, not so much the low-level logic.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> In all actuality, it would take AT LEAST 20 sample images to give an
accurate representation of the data I'm working with. It varies a lot. But I
do have a sample here, here, and here. These images have already been
processed by my coworker's process. The red, blue, and green data is what I
have to classify (red stands for dark crack, blue stands for light crack, and
green stands for a wide/sealed crack).</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In addition to the useful comments about image processing, it also sounds like
you're dealing with a clustering problem.</p>
<p>Clustering algorithms come from the machine learning literature, specifically
unsupervised learning. As the name implies, the basic idea is to try to
<strong>identify natural clusters</strong> of data points within some large set of data.</p>
<p>For example, the picture below shows how a clustering algorithm might group a
bunch of points into 7 clusters (indicated by circles and color):</p>
<p><img alt="k-means" src="images/pFQkQ.png"><br>
(source: natekohl.net)</p>
<p>In your case, a clustering algorithm would attempt to repeatedly merge small
cracks to form larger cracks, until some stopping criteria is met. The end
result would be a smaller set of joined cracks. Of course, cracks are a little
different than two-dimensional points -- part of the trick in getting a
clustering algorithm to work here will be defining a useful distance metric
between two cracks.</p>
<p>Popular clustering algorithms include k-means clustering (demo) and
hierarchical clustering. That second link also has a nice step-by-step
explanation of how k-means works.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : This paper by some engineers at Phillips looks relevant to what
you're trying to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chenn-Jung Huang, Chua-Chin Wang, Chi-Feng Wu, " <strong>Image Processing Techniques for Wafer Defect Cluster Identification</strong> ," <em>IEEE Design and Test of Computers, vol. 19, no. 2, pp. 44-48, March/April, 2002.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They're doing a visual inspection for defects on silicon wafers, and use a
median filter to remove noise before using a nearest-neighbor clustering
algorithm to detect the defects.</p>
<p>Here are some related papers/books that they cite that might be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>M. Taubenlatt and J. Batchelder, “ <strong>Patterned Wafer Inspection Using Spatial Filtering for Cluster Environment</strong> ,” <em>Applied Optics, vol. 31, no. 17, June 1992, pp. 3354-3362.</em>
</li>
<li>F.-L. Chen and S.-F. Liu, “ <strong>A Neural-Network Approach to Recognize Defect Spatial Pattern in Semiconductor Fabrication.</strong> ” <em>IEEE Trans. Semiconductor Manufacturing, vol. 13, no. 3, Aug. 2000, pp. 366-373.</em>

<p>Your problem falls in the very broad field of image classification. These
types of problems can be notoriously difficult, and at the end of the day,
solving them is an art. You must exploit every piece of knowledge you have
about the problem domain to make it tractable.</p>
<p>One fundamental issue is normalization. You want to have similarly classified
objects to be as similar as possible in their data representation. For
example, if you have an image of the cracks, do all images have the same
orientation? If not, then rotating the image may help in your classification.
Similarly, scaling and translation (refer to this)</p>
<p>You also want to remove as much irrelevant data as possible from your training
sets. Rather than directly working on the image, perhaps you could use edge
extraction (for example Canny edge detection). This will remove all the
'noise' from the image, leaving only the edges. The exercise is then reduced
to identifying which edges are the cracks and which are the natural pavement.</p>
<p>If you want to fast track to a solution then I suggest you first try the your
luck with a Convolutional Neural Net, which can perform pretty good image
classification with a minimum of preprocessing and noramlization. Its pretty
well known in handwriting recognition, and might be just right for what you're
doing.</p>
