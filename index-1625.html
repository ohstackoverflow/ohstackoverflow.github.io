    <p>If I have the actual file and a Bash shell in Mac or Linux, how can I query
the cert file for when it will expire? Not a web site, but actually the
certificate file itself, assuming I have the csr, key, pem and chain files.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>With <code>openssl</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in file.pem
</pre></div>

<p>The output is on the form:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">notAfter=Nov  3 22:23:50 2014 GMT
</pre></div>

<p>Also see MikeW's answer for how to easily check whether the certificate has
expired or not, or whether it will within a certain time period, without
having to parse the date above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>If you just want to know whether the certificate has expired (or will do so
within the next N seconds), the <code>-checkend &lt;seconds&gt;</code> option to <code>openssl x509</code>
will tell you:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">openssl</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x509</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">checkend</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">86400</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">noout</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">file</span>.<span class="nv">pem</span>
<span class="k">then</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Certificate is good for another day!"</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Certificate has expired or will do so within 24 hours!"</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"(or is invalid/not found)"</span>
<span class="nv">fi</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This saves having to do date/time comparisons yourself.</p>
<p><code>openssl</code> will return an exit code of <code>0</code> (zero) if the certificate has not
expired and will not do so for the next 86400 seconds, in the example above.
If the certificate will have expired or has already done so - or some other
error like an invalid/nonexistent file - the return code is <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>(Of course, it assumes the time/date is set correctly)</p>
<p>Be aware that older versions of openssl have a bug which means if the time
specified in <code>checkend</code> is too large, 0 will always be returned
(https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6180).</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2>See <code>REASSIGN OWNED</code> command</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As @trygvis mentions in the answer below, the <code>REASSIGN OWNED</code>
command is available since at least version 8.2, and is a much easier method.</p>

<p>Since you're changing the ownership for all tables, you likely want views and
sequences too. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>Tables:</p>

<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The nature and even existence of file extensions is platform-dependent (some
obscure platforms don't even have them, remember) -- in other systems they're
only conventional (UNIX and its ilk), while in still others they have definite
semantics and in some cases specific limits on length or character content
(Windows, etc.).</p>
<p>Since the maintainers have asked that you use ".yaml", that's as close to an
"official" ruling as you can get, but the habit of 8.3 is hard to get out of
(and, appallingly, still occasionally relevant in 2013).</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So which am I supposed to use? The proper 4 letter extension suggested by

</blockquote>
<p>This question could be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A request for advice; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A natural expression of that particular emotion which is experienced, while one is observing that some official recommendation is being disregarded—prominently, or even predominantly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>People differ in their predilection for following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Official advice; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preponderance of practice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, I am unlikely to influence you, regarding which of these two paths
you prefer to take!</p>
<p>In what follows (and, in the spirit of science), I merely make an hypothesis,
about what (merely as a matter of fact) led the majority of people to use the
3-letter extension. And, I focus on efficient causes.</p>
<p>By this, I do not intend moral exhortation. As you may recall, the fact that
something is, does not imply that it should be.</p>
<p>Whatever your personal inclination, be it to follow one path or the other, I
do not object.</p>
<p>(End of edit.)</p>
<p>The suggestion, that this preference (in real life usage) was caused by a 8.3
character DOS-ish limitation, IMO is a red herring (erroneous and misleading).</p>
<p>As of August, 2016, the Google search counts for YML and YAML were
approximately 6,000,000 and 4,100,000 (to two digits of precision).
Furthermore, the "YAML" count was unfairly high because it included mention of
the language by name, beyond its use as an extension.</p>
<p>As of July, 2018, the Google's search counts for YML and YAML were
approximately 8,100,000 and 4,100,000 (again, to two digits of precision). So,
in the last two years, YML has essentially doubled in popularity, but YAML has
stayed the same.</p>
<p>Another cultural measure is websites which attempt to explain file extensions.
For example, on the FilExt website (as of July, 2018), the page for YAML
results in: "Ooops! The FILEXT.com database does not have any information on
file extension .YAML."</p>
<p>Whereas, it has an entry for YML, which gives: "YAML...uses a text file and
organizes it into a format which is Human-readable. 'database.yml' is a
typical example when YAML is used by Ruby on Rails to connect to a database."</p>
<p>As of November, 2014, Wikipedia's article on extension YML still stated that
".yml" is " <em>the</em> file extension for the YAML file format" (emphasis added).
Its YAML article lists both extensions, without expressing a preference.</p>
<p>The extension ".yml" is sufficiently clear, is more brief (thus easier to type
and recognize), and is much more common.</p>
<p>Of course, both of these extensions could be viewed as abbreviations of a
long, possible extension, ".yamlaintmarkuplanguage". But programmers (and
users) don't want to type all of that!</p>
<p>Instead, we programmers (and users) want to type as little as possible, and
still yet be unambiguous and clear. And we want to see what kind of file it
is, as quickly as possible, without reading a longer word. Typing just how
many characters accomplishes both of these goals? Isn't the answer three (3)?
In other words, YML?</p>
<p>Wikipedia's Category:Filename_extensions page lists entries for .a, .o and .Z.
Somehow, it missed .c and .h (used by the C language). These example single-
letter extensions help us to see that extensions should be as long as
necessary, but no longer (to half-quote Albert Einstein).</p>
<p>Instead, notice that, in general, few extensions start with "Y". Commonly, on
the other hand, the letter X is used for a great variety of meanings including
"cross," "extensible," "extreme," "variable," etc. (e.g. in XML). So starting
with "Y" already conveys much information (in terms of information theory),
whereas starting with "X" does not.</p>
<p>Linguistically speaking, therefore, the acronym "XML" has (in a way) only two
informative letters ("M" and "L"). "YML", instead, has three informative
letters ("M", "L" and "Y"). Indeed, the existing set of acronyms beginning
with Y seems extremely small. By implication, this is why a four letter YAML
file extension feels greatly overspecified.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why we see in practice that the "linguistic" pressure (in
natural use) to lengthen the abbreviation in question to four (4) characters
is weak, and the "linguistic" pressure to shorten this abbreviation to three
(3) characters is strong.</p>
<p>Purely as a result, probably, of these factors (and not as an official
endorsement), I would note that the YAML.org website's latest news item (from
November, 2011) is all about a project written in JavaScript, JS-YAML, which,
itself, internally prefers to use the extension ".yml".</p>
<p>The above-mentioned factors may have been the main ones; nevertheless, all the
factors (known or unknown) have resulted in the abbreviated, three (3)
character extension becoming the one in predominant use for YAML—despite the
inventors' preference.</p>
<p>".YML" seems to be the <em>de facto</em> standard. Yet the same inventors were
perceptive and correct, about the world's need for a human-readable data
language. And we should thank them for providing it.</p>
