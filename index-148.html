    <p>How does data binding work in the <code>AngularJS</code> framework?</p>
<p>I haven't found technical details on their site. It's more or less clear how
it works when data is propagated from view to model. But how does AngularJS
track changes of model properties without setters and getters?</p>
<p>I found that there are JavaScript watchers that may do this work. But they are
not supported in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. So how does
AngularJS know that I changed for example the following and reflected this
change on a view?</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">myobject.myproperty="new value";
</pre></div>

<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>AngularJS remembers the value and compares it to a previous value. This is
basic dirty-checking. If there is a change in value, then it fires the change
event.</p>
<p>The <code>$apply()</code> method, which is what you call when you are transitioning from
a non-AngularJS world into an AngularJS world, calls <code>$digest()</code>. A digest is
just plain old dirty-checking. It works on all browsers and is totally
predictable.</p>
<p>To contrast dirty-checking (AngularJS) vs change listeners (KnockoutJS and
Backbone.js): While dirty-checking may seem simple, and even inefficient (I
will address that later), it turns out that it is semantically correct all the
time, while change listeners have lots of weird corner cases and need things
like dependency tracking to make it more semantically correct. KnockoutJS
dependency tracking is a clever feature for a problem which AngularJS does not
have.</p>
<h2>Issues with change listeners:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The syntax is atrocious, since browsers do not support it natively. Yes, there are proxies, but they are not semantically correct in all cases, and of course there are no proxies on old browsers. The bottom line is that dirty-checking allows you to do POJO, whereas KnockoutJS and Backbone.js force you to inherit from their classes, and access your data through accessors.</li>
<li>Change coalescence. Suppose you have an array of items. Say you want to add items into an array, as you are looping to add, each time you add you are firing events on change, which is rendering the UI. This is very bad for performance. What you want is to update the UI only once, at the end. The change events are too fine-grained.</li>
<li>Change listeners fire immediately on a setter, which is a problem, since the change listener can further change data, which fires more change events. This is bad since on your stack you may have several change events happening at once. Suppose you have two arrays which need to be kept in sync for whatever reason. You can only add to one or the other, but each time you add you fire a change event, which now has an inconsistent view of the world. This is a very similar problem to thread locking, which JavaScript avoids since each callback executes exclusively and to completion. Change events break this since setters can have far-reaching consequences which are not intended and non obvious, which creates the thread problem all over again. It turns out that what you want to do is to delay the listener execution, and guarantee, that only one listener runs at a time, hence any code is free to change data, and it knows that no other code runs while it is doing so.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What about performance?</h2>
<p>So it may seem that we are slow, since dirty-checking is inefficient. This is
where we need to look at real numbers rather than just have theoretical
arguments, but first let's define some constraints.</p>
<p>Humans are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Slow</em> — Anything faster than 50 ms is imperceptible to humans and thus can be considered as "instant".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Limited</em> — You can't really show more than about 2000 pieces of information to a human on a single page. Anything more than that is really bad UI, and humans can't process this anyway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the real question is this: How many comparisons can you do on a browser in
50 ms? This is a hard question to answer as many factors come into play, but
here is a test case: http://jsperf.com/angularjs-digest/6 which creates 10,000
watchers. On a modern browser this takes just under 6 ms. On Internet Explorer
8 it takes about 40 ms. As you can see, this is not an issue even on slow
browsers these days. There is a caveat: The comparisons need to be simple to
fit into the time limit... Unfortunately it is way too easy to add a slow
comparison into AngularJS, so it is easy to build slow applications when you
don't know what you are doing. But we hope to have an answer by providing an
instrumentation module, which would show you which are the slow comparisons.</p>
<p>It turns out that video games and GPUs use the dirty-checking approach,
specifically because it is consistent. As long as they get over the monitor
refresh rate (typically 50-60 Hz, or every 16.6-20 ms), any performance over
that is a waste, so you're better off drawing more stuff, than getting FPS
higher.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Misko already gave an excellent description of how the data bindings work, but
I would like to add my view on the performance issue with the data binding.</p>
<p>As Misko stated, around 2000 bindings are where you start to see problems, but
you shouldn't have more than 2000 pieces of information on a page anyway. This
may be true, but not every data-binding is visible to the user. Once you start
building any sort of widget or data grid with two-way binding you can <em>easily</em>
hit 2000 bindings, without having a bad UX.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a combo box where you can type text to filter the
available options. This sort of control could have ~150 items and still be
highly usable. If it has some extra feature (for example a specific class on
the currently selected option) you start to get 3-5 bindings per option. Put
three of these widgets on a page (e.g. one to select a country, the other to
select a city in the said country, and the third to select a hotel) and you
are somewhere between 1000 and 2000 bindings already.</p>
<p>Or consider a data-grid in a corporate web application. 50 rows per page is
not unreasonable, each of which could have 10-20 columns. If you build this
with ng-repeats, and/or have information in some cells which uses some
bindings, you could be approaching 2000 bindings with this grid alone.</p>
<p>I find this to be a <strong>huge</strong> problem when working with AngularJS, and the only
solution I've been able to find so far is to construct widgets without using
two-way binding, instead of using ngOnce, deregistering watchers and similar
tricks, or construct directives which build the DOM with jQuery and DOM
manipulation. I feel this defeats the purpose of using Angular in the first
place.</p>
<p>I would love to hear suggestions on other ways to handle this, but then maybe
I should write my own question. I wanted to put this in a comment, but it
turned out to be way too long for that...</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>
The data binding can cause performance issues on complex pages.</p>

<p>Now how can I break out of both loops? I've looked at similar questions, but
none concerns Java specifically. I couldn't apply these solutions because most
used gotos.</p>
<p>I don't want to put the inner loop in a different method.</p>
<p>I don't want to return the loops. When breaking I'm finished with the
execution of the loop block.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Like other answerers, I'd definitely <em>prefer</em> to put the loops in a different
method, at which point you can just return to stop iterating completely. This
answer just shows how the requirements in the question can be met.</p>
<p>You can use <code>break</code> with a label for the outer loop. For example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">Test</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Technically the correct answer is to label the outer loop. In practice if you
want to exit at any point inside an inner loop then you would be better off
externalizing the code into a method (a static method if needs be) and then
call it.</p>
<p>That would pay off for readability.</p>
<p>The code would become something like that:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">private</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">search</span><span class="ss">(</span>...<span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">Type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">type</span><span class="w"> </span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">types</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{

    <p>This has always confused me. It seems like this would be nicer:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">["Hello", "world"].join("-")
</pre></div>

<p>Than this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">"-".join(["Hello", "world"])
</pre></div>

<p>Is there a specific reason it is like this?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>It's because any iterable can be joined (e.g, list, tuple, dict, set), but its
contents and the "joiner" <em>must be</em> strings.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">'_'.join(['welcome', 'to', 'stack', 'overflow'])
'_'.join(('welcome', 'to', 'stack', 'overflow'))



'welcome_to_stack_overflow'
</pre></div>

<p>Using something other than strings will raise the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was discussed in the String methods... finally thread in the Python-Dev
achive, and was accepted by Guido. This thread began in Jun 1999, and
<code>str.join</code> was included in Python 1.6 which was released in Sep 2000 (and
supported Unicode). Python 2.0 (supported <code>str</code> methods including <code>join</code>) was
released in Oct 2000.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were four options proposed in this thread: <ul>
<li><code>str.join(seq)</code></li>
<li><code>seq.join(str)</code></li>
<li><code>seq.reduce(str)</code></li>
<li>
<code>join</code> as a built-in function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guido wanted to support not only <code>list</code>s and <code>tuple</code>s, but all sequences/iterables.</li>
<li>
<code>seq.reduce(str)</code> is difficult for newcomers.</li>
<li>
<code>seq.join(str)</code> introduces unexpected dependency from sequences to str/unicode.</li>
<li>
<code>join()</code> as a free-standing built-in function would support only specific data types. So using a built-in namespace is not good. If <code>join()</code> were to support many data types, creating an optimized implementation would be difficult: if implemented using the <code>__add__</code> method then it would be O(n²).</li>
<li>The separator string (<code>sep</code>) should not be omitted. Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some additional thoughts (my own, and my friend's):</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicode support was coming, but it was not final. At that time UTF-8 was the most likely about to replace UCS-2/-4. To calculate total buffer length for UTF-8 strings, the method needs to know the character encoding.</li>
<li>At that time, Python had already decided on a common sequence interface rule where a user could create a sequence-like (iterable) class. But Python didn't support extending built-in types until 2.2. At that time it was difficult to provide basic <code>iterable</code> class (which is mentioned in another comment).</li>
</ul>
<p>Guido's decision is recorded in a historical mail, deciding on
<code>str.join(seq)</code>:</p>
