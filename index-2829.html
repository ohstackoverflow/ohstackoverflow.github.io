    <p>I'm trying to implement a layout which contains <code>RecyclerView</code> and
<code>ScrollView</code> at the same layout.</p>
<p>Layout template:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;RelativeLayout&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;ScrollView</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">android:id=</span><span class="s">"@+id/myScrollView"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="w">       </span><span class="nt">&lt;android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView</span>
<span class="w">            </span><span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">"match_parent"</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;/ScrollView&gt;</span><span class="w">   </span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Problems: I can scroll until the last element of <code>ScrollView</code>.</p>
<p>Things I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Card view inside the <code>ScrollView</code> (now <code>ScrollView</code> contains <code>RecyclerView</code>) - can see the card up until the <code>RecyclerView</code>.</li>
<li>Initial thought was to implement this <code>ViewGroup</code> using <code>RecyclerView</code> instead of <code>ScrollView</code> where one of it's views type is the <code>CardView</code>, but I got the exact same results as with the <code>ScrollView</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>use <code>NestedScrollView</code> instead of <code>ScrollView</code></p>
<p>Please go through NestedScrollView reference document for more information.</p>
<p>and add <code>recyclerView.setNestedScrollingEnabled(false);</code> to your
<code>RecyclerView</code></p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I know I am late it the game, but the issue still exists even after google has
made fix on the <code>android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView</code></p>
<p>The issue I get now is <code>RecyclerView</code> with <code>layout_height=wrap_content</code> not
taking height of all the items issue inside <code>ScrollView</code> that <strong>only</strong> happens
on Marshmallow and Nougat+ (API 23, 24, 25) versions.<br><em>(UPDATE: Replacing<code>ScrollView</code> with
<code>android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView</code> works on all versions. I somehow
missed testing accepted solution. Added this in my github project as demo.)</em></p>
<p>After trying different things, I have found workaround that fixes this issue.</p>
<p>Here is my layout structure in a nutshell:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;ScrollView&gt;
  &lt;LinearLayout&gt; (vertical - this is the only child of scrollview)
     &lt;SomeViews&gt;
     &lt;RecyclerView&gt; (layout_height=wrap_content)
     &lt;SomeOtherViews&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The workaround is the wrap the <code>RecyclerView</code> with <code>RelativeLayout</code>. Don't ask
me how I found this workaround!!! <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;RelativeLayout</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">"match_parent"</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">"wrap_content"</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="na">android:descendantFocusability=</span><span class="s">"blocksDescendants"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">"match_parent"</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">"wrap_content"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Complete example is available on <strong>GitHub</strong> project -

    <p>The 'algebraic' expression for algebraic data types looks very suggestive to
someone with a background in mathematics. Let me try to explain what I mean.</p>
<p>Having defined the basic types</p>
<ul>
<li>Product <code>•</code>
</li>
<li>Union <code>+</code>
</li>
<li>Singleton <code>X</code>
</li>
<li>Unit <code>1</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and using the shorthand <code>X²</code> for <code>X•X</code> and <code>2X</code> for <code>X+X</code> et cetera, we can
then define algebraic expressions for e.g. linked lists</p>
<p><code>data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)</code> ↔ <code>L = 1 + X • L</code></p>
<p>and binary trees:</p>
<p><code>data Tree a = Nil | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)</code> ↔ <code>T = 1 + X • T²</code></p>
<p>Now, my first instinct as a mathematician is to go nuts with these
expressions, and try to solve for <code>L</code> and <code>T</code>. I could do this through
repeated substitution, but it seems much easier to abuse the notation
horrifically and pretend I can rearrange it at will. For example, for a linked
list:</p>
<p><code>L = 1 + X • L</code></p>
<p><code>(1 - X) • L = 1</code></p>
<p><code>L = 1 / (1 - X) = 1 + X + X² + X³ + ...</code></p>
<p>where I've used the power series expansion of <code>1 / (1 - X)</code> in a totally
unjustified way to derive an interesting result, namely that an <code>L</code> type is
either <code>Nil</code>, or it contains 1 element, or it contains 2 elements, or 3, etc.</p>
<p>It gets more interesting if we do it for binary trees:</p>
<p><code>T = 1 + X • T²</code></p>
<p><code>X • T² - T + 1 = 0</code></p>
<p><code>T = (1 - √(1 - 4 • X)) / (2 • X)</code></p>
<p><code>T = 1 + X + 2 • X² + 5 • X³ + 14 • X⁴ + ...</code></p>
<p>again, using the power series expansion (done with Wolfram Alpha). This
expresses the non-obvious (to me) fact that there is only one binary tree with
1 element, 2 binary trees with two elements (the second element can be on the
left or the right branch), 5 binary trees with three elements etc.</p>
<p>So my question is - what am I doing here? These operations seem unjustified
(what exactly is the square root of an algebraic data type anyway?) but they
lead to sensible results. does the quotient of two algebraic data types have
any meaning in computer science, or is it just notational trickery?</p>
<p>And, perhaps more interestingly, is it possible to extend these ideas? Is
there a theory of the algebra of types that allows, for example, arbitrary
functions on types, or do types require a power series representation? If you
can define a class of functions, then does composition of functions have any
meaning?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: A lot of this doesn't really work quite right when you account for
⊥, so I'm going to blatantly disregard that for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>A few initial points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note that "union" is probably not the best term for A+B here--that's specifically a <em>disjoint</em> union of the two types, because the two sides are distinguished even if their types are the same. For what it's worth, the more common term is simply "sum type".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singleton types are, effectively, all unit types. They behave identically under algebraic manipulations and, more importantly, the amount of information present is still preserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You probably want a zero type as well. Haskell provides that as <code>Void</code>. There are no values whose type is zero, just as there is one value whose type is one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's still one major operation missing here but I'll get back to that in a
moment.</p>
<p>As you've probably noticed, Haskell tends to borrow concepts from Category
Theory, and all of the above has a very straightforward interpretation as
such:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given objects A and B in <strong>Hask</strong> , their product A×B is the unique (up to isomorphism) type that allows two projections <em>fst</em> : A×B → A and <em>snd</em> : A×B → B, where given any type C and functions <em>f</em> : C → A, <em>g</em> : C → B you can define the pairing <em>f &amp;&amp;&amp; g</em> : C → A×B such that <em>fst ∘ (f &amp;&amp;&amp; g)</em> = <em>f</em> and likewise for <em>g</em>. Parametricity guarantees the universal properties automatically and my less-than-subtle choice of names should give you the idea. The <code>(&amp;&amp;&amp;)</code> operator is defined in <code>Control.Arrow</code>, by the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dual of the above is the coproduct A+B with injections <em>inl</em> : A → A+B and <em>inr</em> : B → A+B, where given any type C and functions <em>f</em> : A → C, <em>g</em> : B → C, you can define the copairing <em>f ||| g</em> : A+B → C such that the obvious equivalences hold. Again, parametricity guarantees most of the tricky parts automatically. In this case, the standard injections are simply <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> and the copairing is the function <code>either</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the properties of product and sum types can be derived from the above.
Note that any singleton type is a terminal object of <strong>Hask</strong> and any empty
type is an initial object.</p>
<p>Returning to the aforementioned missing operation, in a cartesian closed
category you have exponential objects that correspond to arrows of the
category. Our arrows are functions, our objects are types with kind <code>*</code>, and
the type <code>A -&gt; B</code> indeed behaves as BA in the context of algebraic
manipulation of types. If it's not obvious why this should hold, consider the
type <code>Bool -&gt; A</code>. With only two possible inputs, a function of that type is
isomorphic to two values of type <code>A</code>, i.e. <code>(A, A)</code>. For <code>Maybe Bool -&gt; A</code> we
have three possible inputs, and so on. Also, observe that if we rephrase the
copairing definition above to use algebraic notation, we get the identity CA ×
CB = CA+B.</p>
<p>As for <em>why</em> this all makes sense--and in particular why your use of the power
series expansion is justified--note that much of the above refers to the
"inhabitants" of a type (i.e., distinct values having that type) in order to
demonstrate the algebraic behavior. To make that perspective explicit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The product type <code>(A, B)</code> represents a value each from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, taken independently. So for any fixed value <code>a :: A</code>, there is one value of type <code>(A, B)</code> for each inhabitant of <code>B</code>. This is of course the cartesian product, and the number of inhabitants of the product type is the product of the number of inhabitants of the factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sum type <code>Either A B</code> represents a value from either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>, with the left and right branches distinguished. As mentioned earlier, this is a disjoint union, and the number of inhabitants of the sum type is the sum of the number of inhabitants of the summands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exponential type <code>B -&gt; A</code> represents a mapping from values of type <code>B</code> to values of type <code>A</code>. For any fixed argument <code>b :: B</code>, any value of <code>A</code> can be assigned to it; a value of type <code>B -&gt; A</code> picks one such mapping for each input, which is equivalent to a product of as many copies of <code>A</code> as <code>B</code> has inhabitants, hence the exponentiation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's tempting at first to treat types as sets, that doesn't actually
work very well in this context--we have disjoint union rather than the
standard union of sets, there's no obvious interpretation of intersection or
many other set operations, and we don't usually care about set membership
(leaving that to the type checker).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the constructions above spend a lot of time talking about
<em>counting</em> inhabitants, and <em>enumerating</em> the possible values of a type is a
useful concept here. That quickly leads us to enumerative combinatorics, and
if you consult the linked Wikipedia article you'll find that one of the first
things it does is define "pairs" and "unions" in exactly the same sense as
product and sum types by way of generating functions, then does the same for
"sequences" that are identical to Haskell's lists using exactly the same
technique you did.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oh, and here's a quick bonus that I think demonstrates the point
strikingly. You mentioned in a comment that for a tree type <code>T = 1 + T^2</code> you
can derive the identity <code>T^6 = 1</code>, which is clearly wrong. However, <code>T^7 = T</code>
<em>does</em> hold, and a bijection between trees and seven-tuples of trees can be
constructed directly, cf. Andreas Blass's "Seven Trees in One".</p>
<p><strong>Edit×2:</strong> On the subject of the "derivative of a type" construction
mentioned in other answers, you might also enjoy this paper from the same
author which builds on the idea further, including notions of division and
other interesting whatnot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Binary trees are defined by the equation <code>T=1+XT^2</code> in the semiring of types.
By construction, <code>T=(1-sqrt(1-4X))/(2X)</code> is defined by the same equation in
the semiring of complex numbers. So given that we're solving the same equation
in the same class of algebraic structure it actually shouldn't be surprising
that we see some similarities.</p>
<p>The catch is that when we reason about polynomials in the semiring of complex
numbers we typically use the fact that the complex numbers form a ring or even
a field so we find ourselves using operations such as subtraction that don't
apply to semirings. But we can often eliminate subtractions from our arguments
if we have a rule that allows us to cancel from both sides of an equation.
This is the kind of thing proved by Fiore and Leinster showing that many
arguments about rings can be transferred to semirings.</p>
<p>This means that lots of your mathematical knowledge about rings can be
reliably transferred to types. As a result, some arguments involving complex
numbers or power series (in the ring of formal power series) can carry over to
types in a completely rigorous way.</p>
<p>However there's more to the story than this. It's one thing to prove two types
are equal (say) by showing two power series are equal. But you can also deduce
information about types by inspecting the terms in the power series. I'm not
sure of what the formal statement here should be. (I recommend Brent Yorgey's
paper on combinatorial species for some work that's closely related but
species are <em>not</em> the same as types.)</p>
<p>What I find utterly mind blowing is that what you've discovered can be
extended to calculus. Theorems about calculus can be transferred over to the
semiring of types. In fact, even arguments about finite differences can be
transferred over and you find that classical theorems from numerical analysis
have interpretations in type theory.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

    <p>I just joined a new C++ software project and I'm trying to understand the
design. The project makes frequent use of unnamed namespaces. For example,
something like this may occur in a class definition file:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">newusertype</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cc</span>

</pre></div>

<p>What are the design considerations that might cause one to use an unnamed
namespace? What are the advantages and disadvantages?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Unnamed namespaces are a utility to make an identifier translation unit local.
They behave as if you would choose a unique name per translation unit for a
namespace:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">namespace</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">unique</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cm">/* empty */</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">using</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">namespace</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">unique</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">namespace</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">unique</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cm">/* namespace body. stuff in here */</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The extra step using the empty body is important, so you can already refer
within the namespace body to identifiers like <code>::name</code> that are defined in
that namespace, since the using directive already took place.</p>
<p>This means you can have free functions called (for example) <code>help</code> that can
exist in multiple translation units, and they won't clash at link time. The
effect is almost identical to using the <code>static</code> keyword used in C which you
can put in in the declaration of identifiers. Unnamed namespaces are a
superior alternative, being able to even make a type translation unit local.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">namespace { int a1; }
static int a2;
</pre></div>

<p>Both <code>a</code>'s are translation unit local and won't clash at link time. But the
difference is that the <code>a1</code> in the anonymous namespace gets a unique name.</p>
<p>Read the excellent article at comeau-computing Why is an unnamed namespace
used instead of static? (Archive.org mirror).</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Having something in an anonymous namespace means it's local to this
translation unit (.cpp file and all its includes) this means that if another
symbol with the same name is defined elsewhere there will not be a violation
of the One Definition Rule (ODR).</p>
<p>This is the same as the C way of having a static global variable or static
function but it can be used for class definitions as well (and should be used
rather than <code>static</code> in C++).</p>
<p>All anonymous namespaces in the same file are treated as the same namespace
and all anonymous namespaces in different files are distinct. An anonymous
namespace is the equivalent of:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">namespace</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">__unique_compiler_generated_identifer0x42</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">using</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">namespace</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">__unique_compiler_generated_identifer0x42</span><span class="p">;</span>
