    <p>What is the difference between these three terms? My university provides the
following definitions:</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong> basically just means that the developer's working
copies are synchronized with a shared mainline several times a day.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> is described as the logical evolution of continuous
integration: Always be able to put a product into production!</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> is described as the logical next step after
continuous delivery: Automatically deploy the product into production whenever
it passes QA!</p>
<p>They also provide a warning: Sometimes the term "Continuous Deployment" is
also used if you are able to continuously deploy to the test system.</p>
<p>All this leaves me confused. Any explaination that is a little more detailed
(or comes with an example) is appreciated!</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>I Agree with your university's definition. <em>Continuous Integration</em> is a
strategy for how a developer can integrate code to the mainline continuously -
as opposed to frequently.</p>
<p>You might claim that it's merely a branching strategy in your version control
system.</p>
<p>It has to do with the size of the tasks you assign to a developer; If a task
is estimated to take 4-5 man-days then the developer will have no incitement
to deliver anything for the next 4-5 days, because he's not done with anything
- yet.</p>
<p>So size matters:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">small task = continuous integration
big task   = frequent integration
</pre></div>

<p>The ideal task size is not bigger than a day's work. This way a developer will
naturally have at least one integration per day.</p>
<h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>
<p>There are basically three <em>schools</em> within Continuous Delivery:</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery is a natural extension of Continuous Integration</strong></p>
<p>This school, looks at the Addison-Wesley "Martin Fowler" signature series and
makes the assumption that since the 2007 release was called <em>"Continuous
Integration"</em> and the one that followed in 2011 was called <em>"Continuous
Delivery"</em> they are probably volume 1+2 of the same conceptual idea that has
to do with continuous <em>something</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery has to do with Agile Software Development</strong></p>
<p>This school takes off-set in the idea that Continuous Delivery is all about
being able to support the principles in the agile movement, not just as a
<em>conceptual idea</em> or a <em>letter of intent</em> but for real - in real life.</p>
<p>Taking offset in the first principle in the Agile Manifesto where the term
"continuous delivery" is actually used for the first time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous
delivery of valuable software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This school claims that "Continuous Delivery" is a paradigm that embraces
everything required to implement an automated verification of your "definition
of done".</p>
<p>This school accepts that "Continuous Delivery" and the buzz word or megatrend
"DevOps" are flip sides of the same coin, in the sense that they both try to
embrace or encapsulate this new paradigm or approach and not just a technique.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery is a synonym to Continuous Deployment</strong></p>
<p>The third school advocates that <em>Continuous Deployment</em> and <em>Continuous
Delivery</em> can be used interchangeably to mean the same thing.</p>
<p>When something is ready in the hands of the developers, it's immediately
delivered to the end-users, which in most cases will mean that it should be
deployed to the production environment. Hence "Deploy" and "Deliver" means the
same.</p>
<h3>Which school to join</h3>
<p>Your university clearly joined the first school and claims that we're
referring to volume 1+2 of the same publication series. My opinion is that
this is a misuse of the term Continuous Delivery.</p>
<p>I personally advocate for the understanding that <em>Continuous Delivery</em> is
related to implementing a real-life support for the ideas and concepts stated
by the agile movement. So I joined the school that says the term embraces a
whole paradigm - like "DevOps".</p>
<p>The school that uses <em>delivery</em> as a synonym to <em>deploy</em> is mostly advocated
by tool vendors who create deployment consoles, trying to get a bit of hype
from the more widespread use of the term <em>Continuous Delivery</em>.</p>
<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>The focus on Continuous Deployment is mostly relevant in domains where the end
user's access to software updates relies on the update of some centralized
source for this information and where this centralized source is not always
easy to update because it's monolithic or has (too) high coherence by nature
(web, SOA, Databases etc.).</p>
<p>For a lot of domains that produces software where there is no centralized
source of information (devices, consumer products, client installations etc.)
or where the centralized source for information is easy to update (app stores
artifact management systems, Open Source repositories etc.), there is almost
no hype about the term Continuous Deployment at all. They just deploy; it's
not a big thing - it's not a pain that requires special focus.</p>
<p>The fact that Continuous Deployment is not something that is generically
interesting to everyone is also an argument that the school that claims that
"delivery" and "deploy" are synonyms got it all wrong. Because Continuous
Delivery actually makes perfectly good sense to everyone - even if you are
doing embedded software in devices or releasing Open Source plugins for a
framework.</p>
<p>Your university's definition that Continuous Deployment is a natural next step
of Continuous Delivery implicitly assumes that every delivery that is QA'ed
should go become available to the end-users immediately, is closer to the
definition that my tribe use to describe the term "Continous Release", which,
in turn, is another concept that doesn't generically makes sense to everyone
either.</p>
<p>A release can be a very strategic or political thing and there is no reason to
assume that everybody would want to do this all the time (unless they are an
online bookstore a streaming service type of company). Nevertheless, companies
that don't blindly release everything all the time may have any number of
reasons why they would want to be masters of deployment anyway, so they too do
<em>Continuous Deployment</em>. Not of release to production, but of <em>release-
candidates</em> to <em>production-like</em> environments.</p>
<p>Again I believe your university got it wrong. They are mistaking "Continuous
Deployment" for "Continuous Release".</p>
<p><strong>Continuous deployment is simply the discipline of continuously being able to
move the result of a development process to a production-like environment
where functional testing can be executed in full scale.</strong></p>
<h2>The Continuous Delivery Storyline</h2>
<p>In the picture it all comes alive:</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="images/OCqlF.jpg"></p>
<p>The Continuous Integration process is the first two actions in the state-
transition diagram. Which - if successful - kicks off the Continuous Delivery
pipeline that implements the <em>definition of done</em>. Deployment is just one of
the many actions that will have to be done continuously in this pipeline.
Ideally, the process is automated from the point where the developer commits
to the VCS to the point where the pipeline has confirmed that we have a valid
release candidate.</p>

    <p>When using Facebook Sharer, Facebook will offer the user the option of using 1
of a few images pulled from the source as a preview for their link. How are
these images selected, and how can I ensure that any particular image on my
page is <em>always</em> included in this list?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>How do I tell Facebook which image to use when my page gets shared?</h4>
<p>Facebook has a set of open-graph meta tags that it looks at to decide which
image to show.</p>
<p>The keys one for the Facebook image are:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;meta property="og:image" content="http://ia.media-imdb.com/rock.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="https://secure.example.com/ogp.jpg" /&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>and it should be present inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag at the top of your
page.</p>
<p>If these tags are not present, it will look for their older method of
specifying an image: <code>&lt;link rel="image_src" href="/myimage.jpg"/&gt;</code>. If neither
are present, Facebook will look at the content of your page and choose images
from your page that meet its share image criteria: Image must be at least
200px by 200px, have a maximum aspect ratio of 3:1, and in PNG, JPEG or GIF
format.</p>
<p><strong>Can I specify multiple images to allow the user to select an image?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you just need to add multiple image meta tags in the order you want them
to appear in. The user will then be presented with an image selector dialog:<br><img alt="Facebook Image Selector" src="images/WyErv.png"></p>
<p><strong>I specified the appropriate image meta tags. Why isn't Facebook accepting
the changes?</strong></p>
<p>Once a url has been shared, Facebook's crawler, which has a user agent of
<code>facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+https://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php)</code>,
will access your page and cache the meta information. To force Facebook
servers to clear the cache, use the Facebook Url Debugger / Linter Tool that
they launched in June 2010 to refresh the cache and troubleshoot any meta tag
issues on your page.</p>
<p>Also, the images on the page must be publicly accessible to the Facebook
crawler. You should specify absolute url's like
http://example.com/yourimage.jpg instead of just /yourimage.jpg.</p>
<p><strong>Can I update these meta tags with client side code like Javascript or
jQuery?</strong> No. Much like search engine crawlers, the Facebook scraper does not
execute scripts so whatever meta tags are present when the page is downloaded
are the meta tags that are used for image selection.</p>
<p><strong>Adding these tags causes my page to no longer validate. How can I fix
this?</strong></p>
<p>You can add the necessary Facebook namespaces to your tag and your page should
then pass validation:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:og="http://ogp.me/ns#"
      xmlns:fb="https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"&gt;
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>When you share for Facebook, you have to add in your html into the head
section next meta tags:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;meta property="og:title" content="title" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="description" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image" content="thumbnail_image" /&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>Add the button as you should according to what FB tells you.</p>
<p>All the info you need is in www.facebook.com/share/</p>

    <p>What is the advantage of using an abstract class instead of a trait (apart
from performance)? It seems like abstract classes can be replaced by traits in
most cases.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I can think of two differences</p>
<ol>
<li>Abstract classes can have constructor parameters as well as type parameters. Traits can have only type parameters. There was some discussion that in future even traits can have constructor parameters</li>
<li>Abstract classes are fully interoperable with Java. You can call them from Java code without any wrappers. Traits are fully interoperable only if they do not contain any implementation code</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>

<p>There's a section in Programming in Scala called "To trait, or not to trait?"
which addresses this question. Since the 1st ed is available online, I'm
hoping it's OK to quote the whole thing here. (Any serious Scala programmer
should buy the book):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you implement a reusable collection of behavior, you will have to
decide whether you want to use a trait or an abstract class. There is no
firm rule, but this section contains a few guidelines to consider.</p>
<p><em>If the behavior will not be reused</em> , then make it a concrete class. It is
not reusable behavior after all.</p>
<p><em>If it might be reused in multiple, unrelated classes</em> , make it a trait.
Only traits can be mixed into different parts of the class hierarchy.</p>
<p><em>If you want to inherit from it in Java code</em> , use an abstract class. Since
traits with code do not have a close Java analog, it tends to be awkward to
inherit from a trait in a Java class. Inheriting from a Scala class,
meanwhile, is exactly like inheriting from a Java class. As one exception, a
Scala trait with only abstract members translates directly to a Java
interface, so you should feel free to define such traits even if you expect
Java code to inherit from it. See Chapter 29 for more information on working
with Java and Scala together.</p>
<p><em>If you plan to distribute it in compiled form</em> , and you expect outside
groups to write classes inheriting from it, you might lean towards using an
abstract class. The issue is that when a trait gains or loses a member, any
classes that inherit from it must be recompiled, even if they have not
changed. If outside clients will only call into the behavior, instead of
inheriting from it, then using a trait is fine.</p>
<p><em>If efficiency is very important</em> , lean towards using a class. Most Java
runtimes make a virtual method invocation of a class member a faster
operation than an interface method invocation. Traits get compiled to
interfaces and therefore may pay a slight performance overhead. However, you
should make this choice only if you know that the trait in question
constitutes a performance bottleneck and have evidence that using a class
instead actually solves the problem.</p>
<p><em>If you still do not know</em> , after considering the above, then start by
making it as a trait. You can always change it later, and in general using a
trait keeps more options open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As @Mushtaq Ahmed mentioned, a trait cannot have any parameters passed to the
primary constructor of a class.</p>
<p>Another difference is the treatment of <code>super</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other difference between classes and traits is that whereas in classes,
<code>super</code> calls are statically bound, in traits, they are dynamically bound.
If you write <code>super.toString</code> in a class, you know exactly which method
implementation will be invoked. When you write the same thing in a trait,
however, the method implementation to invoke for the super call is undefined
when you define the trait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the rest of Chapter 12 for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1 (2013):</strong></p>
<p>There is a subtle difference in the way abstract classes behaves compared to
traits. One of the linearization rules is that it preserves the inheritance
hierarchy of the classes, which tends to push abstract classes later in the
chain while traits can happily be mixed in. In certain circumstances, it's
actually preferable to be in latter position of the class linearization, so
abstract classes could be used for that. See constraining class linearization
(mixin order) in Scala.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 (2018):</strong></p>
<p>As of Scala 2.12, trait's binary compatibility behavior has changed. Prior to
2.12, adding or removing a member to the trait required recompilation of all
classes that inherit the trait, even if the classes have not changed. This is
due to the way traits were encoded in JVM.</p>
<p>As of Scala 2.12, traits compile to Java interfaces, so the requirement has
relaxed a bit. If the trait does any of the following, its subclasses still
require recompilation:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>defining fields (<code>val</code> or <code>var</code>, but a constant is ok – <code>final val</code>
without result type)</li>
<li>calling <code>super</code>
</li>
<li>initializer statements in the body</li>
<li>extending a class</li>
<li>relying on linearization to find implementations in the right supertrait
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But if the trait does not, you can now update it without breaking binary
compatibility.</p>
