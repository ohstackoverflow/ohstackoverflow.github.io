    <p>I'm trying to find out if a row exists in a table. Using MySQL, is it better

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You could also try <code>EXISTS</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">SELECT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE ...)
</pre></div>

<p>and per the documentation, you can <code>SELECT</code> anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, an EXISTS subquery starts with SELECT <em>, but it could begin
with SELECT 5 or SELECT column1 or anything at all. </em><em><em>MySQL ignores the
SELECT list in such a subquery, so it makes no difference.</em></em>*</p>

<p>I have made some researches on this subject recently. The way to implement it
has to be different if the field is a TEXT field, a non unique field.</p>
<p>I have made some tests with a TEXT field. Considering the fact that we have a
table with 1M entries. 37 entries are equal to 'something':</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SELECT * FROM test WHERE text LIKE '%something%' LIMIT 1</code> with <code>mysql_num_rows()</code> : 0.039061069488525s. <strong>(FASTER)</strong>

<li>
<code>SELECT count(*) as count FROM test WHERE text LIKE '%something%</code> : 16.028197050095s.</li>
<li>
<code>SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM test WHERE text LIKE '%something%')</code> : 0.87045907974243s.</li>
<li>
<code>SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM test WHERE text LIKE '%something%' LIMIT 1)</code> : 0.044898986816406s.</li>
</ul>
<p>But now, with a BIGINT PK field, only one entry is equal to '321321' :</p>
<ul>

    <p>I have to calculate some floating point variables and my colleague suggest me
to use <code>BigDecimal</code> instead of <code>double</code> since it will be more precise. But I
want to know what it is and how to make most out of <code>BigDecimal</code>?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A <code>BigDecimal</code> is an exact way of representing numbers. A <code>Double</code> has a
certain precision. Working with doubles of various magnitudes (say <code>d1=1000.0</code>
and <code>d2=0.001</code>) could result in the <code>0.001</code> being dropped altogether when
summing as the difference in magnitude is so large. With <code>BigDecimal</code> this
would not happen.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of <code>BigDecimal</code> is that it's slower, and it's a bit more
difficult to program algorithms that way (due to <code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> not being
overloaded).</p>
<p>If you are dealing with money, or precision is a must, use <code>BigDecimal</code>.
Otherwise <code>Doubles</code> tend to be good enough.</p>
<p>I do recommend reading the javadoc of <code>BigDecimal</code> as they do explain things
better than I do here :)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>My English is not good so I'll just write a simple example here.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">double a = 0.02;
double b = 0.03;
double c = b - a;
System.out.println(c);

BigDecimal _a = new BigDecimal("0.02");
BigDecimal _b = new BigDecimal("0.03");
BigDecimal _c = _b.subtract(_a);
System.out.println(_c);
</pre></div>

<p>Why is using an <code>except: pass</code> block bad? What makes it bad? Is it the fact
that I <code>pass</code> on an error or that I <code>except</code> any error?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>As you correctly guessed, there are two sides to it: Catching <em>any</em> error by
specifying no exception type after <code>except</code>, and simply passing it without
taking any action.</p>
<p>My explanation is “a bit” longer—so tl;dr it breaks down to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Don’t catch <em>any</em> error</strong>. Always specify which exceptions you are prepared to recover from and only catch those.</li>
<li>
<strong>Try to avoid passing in except blocks</strong>. Unless explicitly desired, this is usually not a good sign.</li>
</ol>
<p>But let’s go into detail:</p>
<h4>Don’t catch <em>any</em> error</h4>
<p>When using a <code>try</code> block, you usually do this because you know that there is a
chance of an exception being thrown. As such, you also already have an
approximate idea of <em>what</em> can break and what exception can be thrown. In such
cases, you catch an exception because you can <em>positively recover</em> from it.
That means that you are prepared for the exception and have some alternative
plan which you will follow in case of that exception.</p>
<p>For example, when you ask for the user to input a number, you can convert the
input using <code>int()</code> which might raise a <code>ValueError</code>. You can easily recover
that by simply asking the user to try it again, so catching the <code>ValueError</code>
and prompting the user again would be an appropriate plan. A different example
would be if you want to read some configuration from a file, and that file
happens to not exist. Because it is a configuration file, you might have some
default configuration as a fallback, so the file is not exactly necessary. So
catching a <code>FileNotFoundError</code> and simply applying the default configuration
would be a good plan here. Now in both these cases, we have a very specific
exception we expect and have an equally specific plan to recover from it. As
such, in each case, we explicitly only <code>except</code> <em>that certain</em> exception.</p>
<p>However, if we were to catch <em>everything</em> , then—in addition to those
exceptions we are prepared to recover from—there is also a chance that we get
exceptions that we didn’t expect, and which we indeed cannot recover from; or
shouldn’t recover from.</p>
<p>Let’s take the configuration file example from above. In case of a missing
file, we just applied our default configuration and might decide at a later
point to automatically save the configuration (so next time, the file exists).
Now imagine we get a <code>IsADirectoryError</code>, or a <code>PermissionError</code> instead. In
such cases, we probably do not want to continue; we could still apply our
default configuration, but we later won’t be able to save the file. And it’s
likely that the user meant to have a custom configuration too, so using the
default values is likely not desired. So we would want to tell the user about
it immediately, and probably abort the program execution too. But that’s not
something we want to do somewhere deep within some small code part; this is
something of application-level importance, so it should be handled at the
top—so let the exception bubble up.</p>
<p>Another simple example is also mentioned in the Python 2 idioms document.
Here, a simple typo exists in the code which causes it to break. Because we
are catching <em>every</em> exception, we also catch <code>NameError</code>s and <code>SyntaxError</code>s.
Both are mistakes that happen to us all while programming and both are
mistakes we absolutely don’t want to include when shipping the code. But
because we also caught those, we won’t even know that they occurred there and
lose any help to debug it correctly.</p>
<p>But there are also more dangerous exceptions which we are unlikely prepared
for. For example, SystemError is usually something that happens rarely and
which we cannot really plan for; it means there is something more complicated
going on, something that likely prevents us from continuing the current task.</p>
<p>In any case, it’s very unlikely that you are prepared for everything in a
small-scale part of the code, so that’s really where you should only catch
those exceptions you are prepared for. Some people suggest to at least catch
<code>Exception</code> as it won’t include things like <code>SystemExit</code> and
<code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> which <em>by design</em> are to terminate your application, but I
would argue that this is still far too unspecific. There is only one place
where I personally accept catching <code>Exception</code> or just <em>any</em> exception, and
that is in a single global application-level exception handler which has the
single purpose to log any exception we were not prepared for. That way, we can
still retain as much information about unexpected exceptions, which we then
can use to extend our code to handle those explicitly (if we can recover from
them) or—in case of a bug—to create test cases to make sure it won’t happen
again. But of course, that only works if we only ever caught those exceptions
we were already expecting, so the ones we didn’t expect will naturally bubble
up.</p>
<h4>Try to avoid passing in except blocks</h4>
<p>When explicitly catching a small selection of specific exceptions, there are
many situations in which we will be fine by simply doing nothing. In such
cases, just having <code>except SomeSpecificException: pass</code> is just fine. Most of
the time though, this is not the case as we likely need some code related to
the recovery process (as mentioned above). This can be for example something
that retries the action again, or to set up a default value instead.</p>
<p>If that’s not the case though, for example, because our code is already
structured to repeat until it succeeds, then just passing is good enough.
Taking our example from above, we might want to ask the user to enter a
number. Because we know that users like to not do what we ask them for, we
might just put it into a loop in the first place, so it could look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">askForNumber</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">()</span>:
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">True</span>:
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">try</span>:
<span class="w">            </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">int</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">input</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s1">'Please enter a number: '</span><span class="ss">))</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">except</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ValueError</span>:
<span class="w">            </span><span class="nv">pass</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Because we keep trying until no exception is thrown, we don’t need to do
anything special in the except block, so this is fine. But of course, one
might argue that we at least want to show the user some error message to tell
him why he has to repeat the input.</p>
<p>In many other cases though, just passing in an <code>except</code> is a sign that we
weren’t really prepared for the exception we are catching. Unless those
exceptions are simple (like <code>ValueError</code> or <code>TypeError</code>), and the reason why
we can pass is obvious, try to avoid just passing. If there’s really nothing
to do (and you are absolutely sure about it), then consider adding a comment
why that’s the case; otherwise, expand the except block to actually include
some recovery code.</p>
<h4><code>except: pass</code></h4>
<p>The worst offender though is the combination of both. This means that we are
willingly catching <em>any</em> error although we are absolutely not prepared for it
<strong>and</strong> we also don’t do anything about it. You <em>at least</em> want to log the
error and also likely reraise it to still terminate the application (it’s
unlikely you can continue like normal after a MemoryError). Just passing
though will not only keep the application somewhat alive (depending on where
you catch of course), but also throw away all the information, making it
impossible to discover the error—which is especially true if you are not the
one discovering it.</p>
<hr>
<p>So the bottom line is: Catch only exceptions you really expect and are
prepared to recover from; all others are likely either mistakes you should fix
or something you are not prepared for anyway. Passing <em>specific</em> exceptions
are fine if you really don’t need to do something about them. In all other
cases, it’s just a sign of presumption and being lazy. And you definitely want
to fix that.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The main problem here is that it ignores all and any error: Out of memory, CPU
is burning, user wants to stop, program wants to exit, Jabberwocky is killing
users.</p>
<p>This is way too much. In your head, you're thinking "I want to ignore this
network error". If something <em>unexpected</em> goes wrong, then your code silently
continues and breaks in completely unpredictable ways that no one can debug.</p>
<p>That's why you should limit yourself to ignoring specifically only some errors
and let the rest pass.</p>
