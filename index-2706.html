    <p>I am currently developing a .NET application, which consists of 20 projects.
Some of those projects are compiled using .NET 3.5, some others are still .NET
2.0 projects (so far no problem).</p>
<p>The problem is that if I include an external component I always get the
following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does this warning mean and is there maybe a possibility to
exclude this warning (like using #pragma disable in the source code files)?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>This warning means that two projects reference the same assembly (e.g.
<code>System.Windows.Forms</code>) but the two projects require different versions. You
have a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recompile all projects to use the same versions (e.g. move all to .Net 3.5). This is the preferred option because all code is running with the versions of dependencies they were compiled with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a binding redirect. This will suppress the warning. However, your .Net 2.0 projects will (at runtime) be bound to the .Net 3.5 versions of dependent assemblies such as <code>System.Windows.Forms</code>. You can quickly add a binding redirect by double-clicking on error in Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>CopyLocal=true</code>. I'm not sure if this will suppress the warning. It will, like option 2 above, mean that all projects will use the .Net 3.5 version of System.Windows.Forms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a couple of ways to identify the offending reference(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a utility such as the one found at https://gist.github.com/1553265 </li>
<li>Another simple method is to set Build output verbosity (Tools, Options, Projects and Solutions, Build and Run, MSBuild project build output verbosity, Detailed) and after building, search the output window for the warning, and look at the text just above it. <em>(Hat tip to pauloya who suggested this in the comments on this answer)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Basically this happens when the assemblies you're referencing have "Copy
Local" set to "True", meaning that a copy of the DLL is placed in the bin
folder along with your exe.</p>
<p>Since Visual Studio will copy all of the dependencies of a referenced assembly
as well, it's possible to end up with two different builds of the same
assembly being referred to. This is more likely to happen if your projects are
in separate solutions, and can therefore be compiled separately.</p>
<p>The way I've gotten around it is to set Copy Local to False for references in
assembly projects. Only do it for executables/web applications where you need
the assembly for the finished product to run.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense!</p>

    <p>We recently had a problem where, after a series of commits had occurred, a
backend process failed to run. Now, we were good little boys and girls and ran
<code>rake test</code> after every check-in but, due to some oddities in Rails' library
loading, it only occurred when we ran it directly from Mongrel in production
mode.</p>
<p>I tracked the bug down and it was due to a new Rails gem overwriting a method
in the String class in a way that broke one narrow use in the runtime Rails
code.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, is there a way, at runtime, to ask Ruby where a
method has been defined? Something like <code>whereami( :foo )</code> that returns
<code>/path/to/some/file.rb line #45</code>? In this case, telling me that it was defined
in class String would be unhelpful, because it was overloaded by some library.</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee the source lives in my project, so grepping for <code>'def foo'</code>
won't necessarily give me what I need, not to mention if I have <em>many</em> <code>def
foo</code>'s, sometimes I don't know until runtime which one I may be using.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>This is really late, but here's how you can find where a method is defined:</p>
<p>http://gist.github.com/76951</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1"># How to find out where a method comes from.</span>
<span class="c1"># Learned this from Dave Thomas while teaching Advanced Ruby Studio</span>
<span class="c1"># Makes the case for separating method definitions into</span>
<span class="c1"># modules, especially when enhancing built-in classes.</span>
<span class="k">module</span> <span class="n">Perpetrator</span>
  <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">crime</span>
  <span class="nb">end</span>
<span class="nb">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Fixnum</span>
  <span class="n">include</span> <span class="n">Perpetrator</span>
<span class="nb">end</span>

<span class="n">p</span> <span class="mi">2</span>.<span class="k">method</span>(:<span class="n">crime</span>) <span class="c1"># The "2" here is an instance of Fixnum.</span>
<span class="c1">#&lt;Method: Fixnum(Perpetrator)#crime&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you're on Ruby 1.9+, you can use <code>source_location</code></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">require 'csv'

p CSV.new('string').method(:flock)
# =&gt; #&lt;Method: CSV#flock&gt;

CSV.new('string').method(:flock).source_location
# =&gt; ["/path/to/ruby/1.9.2-p290/lib/ruby/1.9.1/forwardable.rb", 180]
</pre></div>

<p>Note that this won't work on everything, like native compiled code. The Method
class has some neat functions, too, like Method#owner which returns the file
where the method is defined.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also see the <code>__file__</code> and <code>__line__</code> and notes for REE in the other
answer, they're handy too. -- wg</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You can actually go a bit further than the solution above. For Ruby 1.8
Enterprise Edition, there is the <code>__file__</code> and <code>__line__</code> methods on <code>Method</code>
instances:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">require 'rubygems'
require 'activesupport'

m = 2.days.method(:ago)
# =&gt; #&lt;Method: Fixnum(ActiveSupport::CoreExtensions::Numeric::Time)#ago&gt;

m.__file__
# =&gt; "/Users/james/.rvm/gems/ree-1.8.7-2010.01/gems/activesupport-2.3.8/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb"
m.__line__
# =&gt; 64
</pre></div>

<p>For Ruby 1.9 and beyond, there is <code>source_location</code> (thanks Jonathan!):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">require</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'active_support/all'</span>
<span class="n">m</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2.</span><span class="n">days</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">method</span><span class="p">(:</span><span class="n">ago</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; #&lt;Method: Fixnum(Numeric)#ago&gt;    # comes from the Numeric module</span>

<span class="n">m</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">source_location</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="c1"># show file and line</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; ["/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.0.6/.../numeric/time.rb", 63]</span>

    <p>I'm trying to understand What the concepts of <strong>young</strong> , <strong>old</strong> and
<strong>permanent generations</strong> are in the Java heap terminology, and more
specifically the interactions between the three generations.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the young generation?</li>
<li>What is the old generation?</li>
<li>What is the permanent generation?</li>
<li>How does the three generations interact/relate to each other?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>This seems like a common misunderstanding. In Oracle's JVM, the permanent
generation is not part of the heap. It's a separate space for class
definitions and related data. In Java 6 and earlier, interned strings were
also stored in the permanent generation. In Java 7, interned strings are
stored in the main object heap.</p>
<p>Here is a good post on permanent generation.</p>
<p>I like the descriptions given for each space in Oracle's guide on JConsole:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the HotSpot Java VM, the memory pools for serial garbage collection are
the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eden Space (heap): The pool from which memory is initially allocated for
most objects.</li>
<li>Survivor Space (heap): The pool containing objects that have survived
the garbage collection of the Eden space.</li>
<li>Tenured Generation (heap): The pool containing objects that have existed
for some time in the survivor space.</li>
<li>Permanent Generation (non-heap): The pool containing all the reflective
data of the virtual machine itself, such as class and method objects. With
Java VMs that use class data sharing, this generation is divided into read-
only and read-write areas.</li>
<li>Code Cache (non-heap): The HotSpot Java VM also includes a code cache,
containing memory that is used for compilation and storage of native code.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Java uses generational garbage collection. This means that if you have an
object foo (which is an instance of some class), the more garbage collection
events it survives (if there are still references to it), the further it gets
promoted. It starts in the young generation (which itself is divided into
multiple spaces - Eden and Survivor) and would eventually end up in the
tenured generation if it survived long enough.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Heap is divided into young and old generations as follows :</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Young Generation</strong> : It is place where lived for short period and divided
into two spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Eden(Adam and Eve first lived) Space</em> : When object created using new keyword memory allocated on this space.</li>
<li>
<em>Survivor Space</em> : This is the pool which contains objects which have survived after java garbage collection from Eden space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Old Generation</strong> : This pool basically contains tenured and virtual
(reserved) space and will be holding those objects which survived after
garbage collection from Young Generation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Tenured Space:</em> This memory pool contains objects which survived after multiple garbage collection means object which survived after garbage collection from Survivor space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permanent Generation :</strong> This memory pool as name also says contain
permanent class metadata and descriptors information so PermGen space always
reserved for classes and those that is tied to the classes for example static
members.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Java8 Update:</strong> <strong>PermGen</strong> is replaced with <strong>Metaspace</strong> which is very
similar.<br>
 Main difference is that Metaspace re-sizes dynamically i.e., It can expand
at runtime.<br>
 Java Metaspace space: unbounded (default)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Code Cache</strong> (Virtual or reserved) : If you are using HotSpot Java VM this
includes code cache area that containing memory which will be used for
compilation and storage of native code.</p>
