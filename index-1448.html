    <p>I'm currently making a pacman game in java. I have a question about the ghosts
though.</p>
<p>I understand that the ghosts do not all have the same style of attack. I first
want to work on the basics of getting the ghost to go after the pacman and not
worry about there differences yet.</p>
<p>My question to you smart people out there is what would be the best way to
make the ghosts chase the pacman but sometimes randomly divert paths. I'm
currently using a 21 by 21 2D array for telling where walls are and such so I
was thinking make it more try and head for the current grid location of
pacman. (for example go to 10,14) Of course while avoiding going through walls
like pacman. I'm wondering how I could make it do this and also have the
ghosts sometimes stop and go another direction or something so that it's not
always a constant chase and pacman has a chance to get away. Maybe some of you
have programmed a pacman game or just know a good way for this. Any help would
be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>(Please note I'm currently in a Grade 11 Computer Science course and halfway
through the first semester ever of learned java.)</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>If you just want the ghosts not all to behave the same, each time they
encounter an intersection, make their decision a random mix of some reasonable
chasing default (such as continuing the way with the shortest distance to
Pacman — Use Dijkstra's algorithm on all successors to pick the best one) and
a random choice.</p>

    <p>I Know general issues include local maxima and plateaus however I am curious
if there is any more issues associated to this specific search and what my
best course of action would be in order to overcome these issues.</p>
<p>Can someone also give me an example of which sort of problem this search would
be good to use for?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Problems with best first search:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is greedy. In many cases it leads to a very quick solution (because your number of developed nodes does not increase exponentially, it is increased linearly with the depth of the solution!), however it is usually not optimized, because your heuristic function has some error and sometimes gets the wrong answer which next node to explore.</li>
<li>There is also an issue with an infinite branch. Assume you are following a branch where node at depth <code>i</code> has a heuristic value of <code>h(v_i) = 2^-i</code>. You will never get to zero, but greedy best first will keep developing these nodes. <br>
Example:<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">                        2
                   / \  
                  /   \
                 /     \
                1      1.5
                |       |
               1/2      1
                |       |
               1/4      0
                |
               1/8
                |
               1/16
                |
               ...
</pre></div>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the above is admissible heuristic function, but nevertheless best
first search will never get the solution, it'll get stuck in the infinite
branch.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To overcome it, we can use an uniformed algorithm (such as Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS for unweighted graphs)</li>
<li>You can use a combination of "best first search" and Dijkstra, which is known as A<em> algorithm. <br>
A</em> Algorithm is actually a greedy best first algorithm, but instead of
choosing according to <code>h(v)</code>, you chose which node to explore next with <code>f(v)
= h(v) + g(v)</code> (where <code>g(v)</code> is the "so far cost". The algorithm is complete
(finds a solution if one exists) and optimal (finds the "best" solution) if it
is given an admissible heuristic function.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When to use Best First Search anyway:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you have a perfect heuristic (denoted as <code>h*</code> in the literature), best first search will find an optimal solution - and fast.</li>
<li>If you don't care about optimal solution, you just want to find one solution fast - it usually does the trick (but you will have to be careful for the infinite branch problem).</li>
<li>When we use A*, we actually use best first search - but on <code>f:V-&gt;R</code> instead of on <code>h:V-&gt;R</code>.</li>
</ol>

    <p>My neural network is normal feed-forward and back prop. Has 10 outputs, which
should be a vector where one of the output is 1, and the rest 0. So something
like [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So an output I would expect is something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">[ 0.21332215,0.13782996,0.13548511,0.09321094,0.16769843,0.20333131, 0.06613014,0.10699013,0.10622562,0.09809167]
</pre></div>

<p>and ideally once trained, this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">[ 0.21332215,0.13782996,0.93548511 ,0.09321094 ,**0.9**676984,0.20333131, 0.06613014,0.1069901,0.10622562, 0.09809167]
</pre></div>

<p>When I have 30 neurons on the hidden layer, and a learning rate of &gt; 0.1 but &lt;
1, i get these results. However, when i have 100 neurons on hidden, and have a
learning rate of 0.01, i get results like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">[  1.75289110e-05,1.16433042e-04 ,2.83848791e-01,4.47291309e-02, 1.63011592e-01,8.12974408e-05 , 1.06284533e-03 , 2.95174797e-02, 7.54112632e-05, 1.33177529e-03]
</pre></div>

<p>Why is this? Is this what over-learning looks like?</p>
<p>Then, when I change the learning rate to 0.0001 with 100 neurons on hidden, it
get normal results again.</p>
<p>So my question is: how should the learning rate affect the hidden layer count?
Should bigger hidden layers mean lower learning rates?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>It can be said that there is a slight relation between the hidden unit count
and the learning rate, in general, when you increase the hidden unit count,
you obtain a more heavily parametrised model with a higher capacity and such a
model is always more prone to overfitting on the same training set. In
addition to that, this model operates in a space with a larger dimension and
has a more complex error surface compared to a thinner model. When you apply a
larger learning rate in such a complex error regime, the SGD process may
easily diverge to meaningless locations, which I believe, is the real reason
you are getting that weird results with the higher learning rate. In short, it
is logical that smaller learning rates work more reasonably when the model is
too complex.</p>
