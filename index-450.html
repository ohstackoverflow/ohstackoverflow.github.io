    <p>I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other
developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a
lot of baggage to the relationship.</p>
<p>I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I
just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge,
everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to
me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.</p>
<p>My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly,
and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For
example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</pre></div>

<p>Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch,
and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch
always stays local.</p>
<p>Here is the workflow that I started with</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch
</pre></div>

<p>There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of
rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the
remote repository.</p>
<p>My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm
working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if
something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I
hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.</p>
<p>My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be
standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that
what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be
unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and
they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to
merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts
with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to
me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a
forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts
resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.</p>
<p>What is the "correct" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to
make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2011-04-15</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two
years experience since I first asked.</p>
<p>It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In
other words, this is what we do and it works:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</pre></div>

<p>In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do <em>squash merges</em>
instead of raw merges. ( <strong>Note: This is controversial, see below.</strong> ) This
allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master.
Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our
commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is
what we do:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m "added my_new_feature"
git branch -D my_new_feature
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Squash Merge Controversy</strong> - As several commenters have pointed out, the
squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name
implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small
features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For
larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual
commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.</p>
<p><strong>Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests</strong> - In case you're wondering
how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above
steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually
merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash
merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the
accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know).
Specifically, it works like this:</p>

    <p>I have gone through Google and Stack Overflow search, but nowhere I was able
to find a clear and straightforward explanation for how to calculate time
complexity.</p>
<h4>What do I know already?</h4>
<p>Say for code as simple as the one below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time
</pre></div>

<p>Say for a loop like the one below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; i &lt; N; i++) {</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">Console</span>.<span class="nv">Write</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s1">'Hello, World!!'</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>int i=0;</code> This will be executed only <strong>once</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time is actually calculated to <code>i=0</code> and not the declaration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>i &lt; N;</code> This will be executed <strong>N+1</strong> times</li>
<li>
<code>i++</code> This will be executed <strong>N</strong> times</li>
</ul>
<p>So the number of operations required by this loop are <strong>{1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2</strong>.
(But this still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding.)</p>
<p>OK, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have
seen the time complexity as <strong>O(N), O(n^2), O(log n), O(n!)</strong> , and many
others.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How to find time complexity of an algorithm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You add up how many machine instructions it will execute as a function of the
size of its input, and then simplify the expression to the largest (when N is
very large) term and can include any simplifying constant factor.</p>
<p>For example, lets see how we simplify <code>2N + 2</code> machine instructions to
describe this as just <code>O(N)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we remove the two<code>2</code>s ?</strong></p>
<p>We are interested in the performance of the algorithm as N becomes large.</p>
<p>Consider the two terms 2N and 2.</p>
<p>What is the relative influence of these two terms as N becomes large? Suppose
N is a million.</p>
<p>Then the first term is 2 million and the second term is only 2.</p>
<p>For this reason, we drop all but the largest terms for large N.</p>
<p>So, now we have gone from <code>2N + 2</code> to <code>2N</code>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we are only interested in performance <em>up to constant factors</em>.</p>
<p>This means that we don't really care if there is some constant multiple of
difference in performance when N is large. The unit of 2N is not well-defined
in the first place anyway. So we can multiply or divide by a constant factor
to get to the simplest expression.</p>
<p>So <code>2N</code> becomes just <code>N</code>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>This is an excellent article: <em>Time complexity of algorithm</em></p>
<p><strong>The below answer is copied from above (in case the excellent link goes
bust)</strong></p>
<p>The most common metric for calculating time complexity is Big O notation. This
removes all constant factors so that the running time can be estimated in
relation to N as N approaches infinity. In general you can think of it like
this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">statement;
</pre></div>

<p>Is constant. The running time of the statement will not change in relation to
N.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; i &lt; N; i++ )</span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="nv">statement</span><span class="c1">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Is linear. The running time of the loop is directly proportional to N. When N
doubles, so does the running time.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; i &lt; N; i++ ) {</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">j</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; j &lt; N; j++ )</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">statement</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>Is quadratic. The running time of the two loops is proportional to the square

<p>Is logarithmic. The running time of the algorithm is proportional to the
number of times N can be divided by 2. This is because the algorithm divides
the working area in half with each iteration.</p>

<p>Is N * log (N). The running time consists of N loops (iterative or recursive)
that are logarithmic, thus the algorithm is a combination of linear and
logarithmic.</p>
<p>In general, doing something with every item in one dimension is linear, doing
something with every item in two dimensions is quadratic, and dividing the
working area in half is logarithmic. There are other Big O measures such as
cubic, exponential, and square root, but they're not nearly as common. Big O
notation is described as <code>O ( &lt;type&gt; )</code> where <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> is the measure. The
quicksort algorithm would be described as <code>O (N * log(N ))</code>.</p>
<p>Note that none of this has taken into account best, average, and worst case
measures. Each would have its own Big O notation. Also note that this is a
VERY simplistic explanation. Big O is the most common, but it's also more
complex that I've shown. There are also other notations such as big omega,
little o, and big theta. You probably won't encounter them outside of an
algorithm analysis course. ;)</p>

    <p>It's common in C++ to name member variables with some kind of prefix to denote
the fact that they're member variables, rather than local variables or
parameters. If you've come from an MFC background, you'll probably use
<code>m_foo</code>. I've also seen <code>myFoo</code> occasionally.</p>
<p>C# (or possibly just .NET) seems to recommend using just an underscore, as in
<code>_foo</code>. Is this allowed by the C++ standard?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The rules (which did not change in C++11):</p>
<ul>
<li>Reserved in any scope, including for use as implementation macros: <ul>
<li>identifiers beginning with an underscore followed immediately by an uppercase letter</li>
<li>identifiers containing adjacent underscores (or "double underscore")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reserved in the global namespace: <ul>
<li>identifiers beginning with an underscore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, everything in the <code>std</code> namespace is reserved. (You are allowed to add template specializations, though.) </li>
</ul>
<p>From the 2003 C++ Standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>17.4.3.1.2 Global names [lib.global.names]</h4>
<p>Certain sets of names and function signatures are always reserved to the
implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each name that contains a double underscore (<code>__</code>) or begins with an
underscore followed by an uppercase letter (2.11) is reserved to the
implementation for any use.</li>
<li>Each name that begins with an underscore is reserved to the
implementation for use as a name in the global namespace.165
</li>
</ul>
<p>165) Such names are also reserved in namespace <code>::std</code> (17.4.3.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because C++ is based on the C standard (1.1/2, C++03) and C99 is a normative
reference (1.2/1, C++03) these also apply, from the 1999 C Standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>7.1.3 Reserved identifiers</h4>
<p>Each header declares or defines all identifiers listed in its associated
subclause, and optionally declares or defines identifiers listed in its
associated future library directions subclause and identifiers which are
always reserved either for any use or for use as file scope identifiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>All identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase
letter or another underscore are always reserved for any use.</li>
<li>All identifiers that begin with an underscore are always reserved for
use as identifiers with file scope in both the ordinary and tag name spaces.</li>
<li>Each macro name in any of the following subclauses (including the future
library directions) is reserved for use as specified if any of its
associated headers is included; unless explicitly stated otherwise (see
7.1.4).</li>
<li>All identifiers with external linkage in any of the following subclauses
(including the future library directions) are always reserved for use as
identifiers with external linkage.154</li>
<li>Each identifier with file scope listed in any of the following
subclauses (including the future library directions) is reserved for use as
a macro name and as an identifier with file scope in the same name space if
any of its associated headers is included.
</li>
</ul>
<p>No other identifiers are reserved. If the program declares or defines an
identifier in a context in which it is reserved (other than as allowed by
7.1.4), or defines a reserved identifier as a macro name, the behavior is
undefined.</p>
<p>If the program removes (with <code>#undef</code>) any macro definition of an identifier
in the first group listed above, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>154) The list of reserved identifiers with external linkage includes
<code>errno</code>, <code>math_errhandling</code>, <code>setjmp</code>, and <code>va_end</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other restrictions might apply. For example, the POSIX standard reserves a lot
of identifiers that are likely to show up in normal code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names beginning with a capital <code>E</code> followed a digit or uppercase letter: <ul>
<li>may be used for additional error code names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with either <code>is</code> or <code>to</code> followed by a lowercase letter <ul>
<li>may be used for additional character testing and conversion functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with <code>LC_</code> followed by an uppercase letter <ul>
<li>may be used for additional macros specifying locale attributes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names of all existing mathematics functions suffixed with <code>f</code> or <code>l</code> are reserved <ul>
<li>for corresponding functions that operate on float and long double arguments, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with <code>SIG</code> followed by an uppercase letter are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional signal names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with <code>SIG_</code> followed by an uppercase letter are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional signal actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names beginning with <code>str</code>, <code>mem</code>, or <code>wcs</code> followed by a lowercase letter are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional string and array functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names beginning with <code>PRI</code> or <code>SCN</code> followed by any lowercase letter or <code>X</code> are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional format specifier macros</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that end with <code>_t</code> are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional type names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While using these names for your own purposes right now might not cause a
problem, they do raise the possibility of conflict with future versions of
that standard.</p>
<hr>
<p>Personally I just don't start identifiers with underscores. New addition to my
rule: Don't use double underscores anywhere, which is easy as I rarely use
underscore.</p>
<p>After doing research on this article I no longer end my identifiers with <code>_t</code>
as this is reserved by the POSIX standard.</p>
<p>The rule about any identifier ending with <code>_t</code> surprised me a lot. I think
that is a POSIX standard (not sure yet) looking for clarification and official
chapter and verse. This is from the GNU libtool manual, listing reserved
names.</p>
<p>CesarB provided the following link to the POSIX 2004 reserved symbols and
notes 'that many other reserved prefixes and suffixes ... can be found there'.
The POSIX 2008 reserved symbols are defined here. The restrictions are
somewhat more nuanced than those above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The rules to avoid collision of names are both in the C++ standard (see
Stroustrup book) and mentioned by C++ gurus (Sutter, etc.).</p>
<h3>Personal rule</h3>
<p>Because I did not want to deal with cases, and wanted a simple rule, I have
designed a <strong>personal</strong> one that is both simple and correct:</p>
<p><strong>When naming a symbol, you will avoid collision with compiler/OS/standard
libraries if you:</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>**</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>never start a symbol with an underscore
**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>never name a symbol with two consecutive underscores inside.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, putting your code in an unique namespace helps to avoid collision,
too (but won't protect against evil macros)</p>
<h3>Some examples</h3>
<p>(I use macros because they are the more code-polluting of C/C++ symbols, but
it could be anything from variable name to class name)</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">#define _WRONG
#define __WRONG_AGAIN
#define RIGHT_
#define WRONG__WRONG
#define RIGHT_RIGHT
#define RIGHT_x_RIGHT
</pre></div>

<h3>Extracts from C++0x draft</h3>
<p>From the n3242.pdf file (I expect the final standard text to be similar):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>17.6.3.3.2 Global names [global.names]</strong></p>
<p>Certain sets of names and function signatures are always reserved to the
implementation:</p>
<p>— Each name that contains a double underscore _ _ or begins with an
underscore followed by an uppercase letter (2.12) is reserved to the
implementation for any use.</p>
<p>— Each name that begins with an underscore is reserved to the implementation
for use as a name in the global namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>17.6.3.3.5 User-defined literal suffixes [usrlit.suffix]</strong></p>
<p>Literal suffix identifiers that do not start with an underscore are reserved
for future standardization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last clause is confusing, unless you consider that a name starting with
one underscore and followed by a lowercase letter would be Ok if <em>not</em> defined
in the global namespace...</p>
