    <p>I was wondering, is it possible to use Artificial Intelligence to make
compilers better?</p>
<p>Things I could imagine if it was possible -</p>
<ul>
<li>More specific error messages </li>
<li>Improving compiler optimizations, so the compiler could actually understand what you're trying to do, and do it better</li>
</ul>
<p>If it <strong>is</strong> possible, are there any research projects on this subject?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You should look at MILEPOST GCC -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MILEPOST GCC is the first practical attept to build machine learning enabled
open-source self-tuning production (and research) compiler that can adapt to
any architecture using iterative feedback-directed compilation, machine
learning and collective optimizatio</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>An optimizing compiler is actually a very complex expert system and Expert
systems is one of the oldest branches of artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>I write programs to play board game variants sometimes. The basic strategy is
standard alpha-beta pruning or similar searches, sometimes augmented by the
usual approaches to endgames or openings. I've mostly played around with chess
variants, so when it comes time to pick my evaluation function, I use a basic
chess evaluation function.</p>
<p>However, now I am writing a program to play a completely new board game. How
do I choose a good or even decent evaluation function?</p>
<p>The main challenges are that the same pieces are always on the board, so a
usual material function won't change based on position, and the game has been
played less than a thousand times or so, so humans don't necessarily play it
enough well yet to give insight. (PS. I considered a MoGo approach, but random
games aren't likely to terminate.)</p>
<p><em>Game details</em> : The game is played on a 10-by-10 board with a fixed six
pieces per side. The pieces have certain movement rules, and interact in
certain ways, but no piece is ever captured. The goal of the game is to have
enough of your pieces in certain special squares on the board. The goal of the
computer program is to provide a player which is competitive with or better
than current human players.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Find a few candidates for your evaluation function, like mobility (# of
possible moves) minus opponent's mobility, then try to find the optimal weight
for each metric. Genetic algorithms seem to work pretty well for optimizing
weights in an evaluation function.</p>
<p>Create a population with random weights, fight them against each other with a
limited depth and turns, replace the losers with random combinations from the
winners, shuffle, and repeat, printing out the population average after every
generation. Let it run until you're satisfied with the result, or until you
see a need to adjust the range for some of the metrics and try again, if it
appears that the optimal value for one metric might be outside your initial
range.</p>
<p><strong>Late edit:</strong> A more accepted, studied, understood approach that I didn't
know at the time is something called "Differential Evolution". Offspring are
created from 3 parents instead of 2, in such a way that avoids the problem of
premature convergence towards the average.</p>

    <p>Even before I learnt programming I've been fascinated with how robots could
work. Now I know how the underlying programming instructions would be written,
but what I don't understand is how those intructions are followed by the
robot.</p>
<p>For example, if I wrote this code:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">object</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">Robot</span>.<span class="nv">ScanSurroundings</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="mi">300</span>,<span class="mi">400</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
<span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">Objects</span>.<span class="nv">isEatable</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">object</span><span class="ss">))</span>
{
<span class="w">   </span><span class="nv">Robot</span>.<span class="nv">moveLeftArm</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="mi">300</span>,<span class="mi">400</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="nv">Robot</span>.<span class="nv">pickObject</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">object</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>How would this program be followed by the CPU in a way that would make the
robot do the physical action of looking to the left, moving his arm, and such?
Is it done primarily in binary language/ASM?</p>
<p>Lastly, where would i go if I wanted to learn how to create a robot?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In most modern robots you would have an Inverse Kinematic model of the
mechanism, in this case the arm, that converts the spatial coordinates into
positions for the joints of the arm. These joints are usually moved by servo
motors. To smoothly move the arm, you need a series of intermediate joint
positions defining the path you want the arm to follow. You also have to worry
about the velocities of the joints, which together control the speed of the
"hand" at the end of the arm.</p>
<p>While the arm is moving your servo system will be getting feedback about its
actual position. Simple servo systems may use a basic PID feedback loop to
adjust the motors. More complex systems will include feed-forward parameters
which compensate for inertia, gravity, friction, and so on. These can become
very sophisticated.</p>
<p>The real fun starts when you have to allow for obstacles in the space around
the robot. You have to sense the obstacle and figure out how to avoid it and
still reach the destination.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You should check out Microsoft Robotics Studio (MRS). They have many
videos/screencasts, and written tutorials. Additionally, Channel9 has many
videos, interviews, etc, on the robitics subject. Including demonstrations,
and interviews with developers of MRS.</p>
