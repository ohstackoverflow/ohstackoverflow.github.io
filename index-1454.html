    <p>When looking at sample contracts, sometimes arrays are declared in methods
with "memory" and sometimes they aren't. What's the difference?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Without the <em>memory</em> keyword, Solidity tries to declare variables in
<em>storage</em>.</p>
<p>Lead Solidity dev chriseth: “You can think of storage as a large array that
has a virtual structure… a structure you cannot change at runtime - it is
determined by the state variables in your contract”.</p>
<p>That is, the structure of storage is set in stone at the time of contract
creation based on your contract-level variable declarations and cannot be
changed by future method calls. BUT -- the contents of that storage can be
changed with sendTransaction calls. Such calls change “state” which is why
contract-level variables are called “state variables”. So a variable <code>uint8
storage var;</code> declared at the contract level can be changed to any valid value
of uint8 (0-255) but that “slot” for a value of type uint8 will always be
there.</p>
<p>If you declare variables in functions without the <em>memory</em> keyword, then
solidity will try to use the storage structure, which currently compiles, but
can produce unexpected results. <em>memory</em> tells solidity to create a chunk of
space for the variable at method runtime, guaranteeing its size and structure
for future use in that method.</p>
<p><em>memory</em> cannot be used at the contract level. Only in methods.</p>
<p>See the the entry "What is the memory keyword? What does it do?" in the FAQ. I
quote it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine has three areas where it can store items.</p>
<p>The first is “storage”, where all the contract state variables reside. Every
contract has its own storage and it is persistent between function calls and
quite expensive to use.</p>
<p>The second is “memory”, this is used to hold temporary values. It is erased
between (external) function calls and is cheaper to use.</p>
<p>The third one is the stack, which is used to hold small local variables. It
is almost free to use, but can only hold a limited amount of values.</p>
<p>For almost all types, you cannot specify where they should be stored,
because they are copied everytime they are used.</p>
<p>The types where the so-called storage location is important are structs and
arrays. If you e.g. pass such variables in function calls, their data is not
copied if it can stay in memory or stay in storage. This means that you can
modify their content in the called function and these modifications will
still be visible in the caller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are defaults for the storage location depending on which type of
variable it concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>state variables are always in storage</li>
<li>function arguments are always in memory</li>
<li>local variables of struct, array or mapping type reference storage by default</li>
<li>local variables of value type (i.e. neither array, nor struct nor mapping) are stored in the stack</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storage holds data between function calls. It is like a computer hard drive. State variables are storage data. These state variables reside in the smart contract data section on the blockchain. Writing variables into storage is very expensive because each node that runs the transaction has to do the same operation, it makes the transaction more expensive and causes the blockchain bigger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory is a temporary place to store data, like RAM. Function args and local variables in functions are memory data. (if the function is external, args will be stored in the stack (calldata)) Ethereum virtual machine has limited space for memory so values stored here are erased between function calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost of global storage is 20,000 wei for writing the first time, 5,000
wei for updating the same storage location, and 200 wei for reading the
storage. It is to be noted that these costs are per 32 bytes of storage. For
example, reading 64 bytes will cost 2 * 200 wei, that is, 400 wei.</p>
<p>The cost of memory storage for both reading and writing 32 bytes of data is
2 wei. The cost of memory is way cheaper than global storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you know accessing data inside a database is more expensive than accessing
data inside the memory (session,cache).</p>
<p>Let's say we want to modify the top-level state variable inside a function.</p>

<p><code>int[] storage myArray=numbers</code> in this case myArray will point to the same
address as "numbers" (it is similar to how referencing objects behave in
javascript). In the function I added 5, then 10 to "numbers" which is placed
into Storage. But if you deploy the code on remix and get <code>numbers[0]</code>, you
will get 1 because of <code>myArray[0]=1</code></p>
<h4>If you define <code>myArray</code> as memory it will be a different story.</h4>

    <p>Git's internal data structure is a tree of data objects, wherein each objects
only points to its predecessor. Each data block is hashed. Modifying (bit
error or attack) an intermediate block will be noticed when the saved hash and
the actual hash deviate.</p>
<p>How is this concept different from block chain?<br>
Git is not listed as an example of block chains, but at least in summaries,
both data structure descriptions look alike: data block, single direction
reverse linking, hashes, ...).</p>
<p>So where is the difference, that Git isn't called a block chain?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The question reads: <em>Why is Git not considered a “block chain”?</em> So this is
asserting that there is a wide-spread opinion that Git is not a blockchain (an
assertion that is illustrated and corroborated by the answers preceding mine
on this page) and asking for the reason of the prevalence of this opinion.
This is a good question.</p>
<p>Taking the question literally, the answer could be that the blockchain term
and concept gained popularity as part of the digital currency operation called
“Bitcoin”, and hence came to be associated with how Bitcoin does things: which
is by using a lot of computing power to calculate a specific hash including a
nonce to meet certain arbitrary requirements, which is by allegedly having no
central authority, which is by being “independent”, maybe even “democratic”,
and the rest of the kool aid; and as these things are not seen in Git, well,
Git cannot be a blockchain, right? And so the question would be answered
literally.</p>
<p>Hidden behind this prima facie question is another question: What is a block
chain? Now you could look up a <em>definition</em> somehwere and copy it over here,
but I didn't do that as I have <em>made up my mind</em> years ago, when listening to
a podcast about Bitcoin that strove to explain the new concept of a
blockchain, that <em>a blockchain works like Git</em> and I don't intend to let my
precious understanding be misled by random claims on the internet.</p>
<p>So what is a blockchain? What's in the word?</p>
<p>Nothing in the term “blockchain” presupposes the requirement to include a
nonce in the content so as to come up with a hash of so and so many leading
zeros. (This requirement is only there to be able to control the blockchain by
computing power and so, ultimately, by money.)</p>
<p>Nothing in the term “blockchain” presupposes the existence of a network, let
alone a decentralized one.</p>
<p>Nothing in the term “blockchain” presupposes any “independence” from “central
authority”.</p>
<p>The term “block chain” only presupposes blocks (of data) chained together. Now
what is a chain? Is it just a link? No, it is a <em>strong</em> link designed to hold
things together by force.</p>
<p>A simple linked list doesn't qualify as a blockchain because the contents of
the chunks of data in the list could be altered while the list would continue
to link back and forth just fine. This is not how a chain works.</p>
<p>To make a <em>link</em> of blocks of data into a <em>chain</em> of blocks of data, the
contents of the blocks need to be checksummed (digested) in one way or another
and this checksum (digest) must be part of the link, making it a strong link
protecting the content, preventing it from being altered. This is a
blockchain.</p>
<p>And this is what Git does, and hence Git is a blockchain, or works as one, if
you prefer.</p>
<p>To close the circle, let's ask again: <em>Why is Git not considered a “block
chain”?</em> It could be because many people, perhaps even a large majority, do
not focus on the essence of a concept but on blinking accidents.</p>

and concept gained popularity as part of the digital currency operation called
“Bitcoin”, and hence came to be associated with how Bitcoin does things: which
is by using a lot of computing power to calculate a specific hash including a
nonce to meet certain arbitrary requirements, which is by allegedly having no
central authority, which is by being “independent”, maybe even “democratic”,
and the rest of the kool aid; and as these things are not seen in Git, well,
Git cannot be a blockchain, right? And so the question would be answered
literally.</p>
<p>Hidden behind this prima facie question is another question: What is a block
chain? Now you could look up a <em>definition</em> somehwere and copy it over here,
but I didn't do that as I have <em>made up my mind</em> years ago, when listening to
a podcast about Bitcoin that strove to explain the new concept of a
blockchain, that <em>a blockchain works like Git</em> and I don't intend to let my
precious understanding be misled by random claims on the internet.</p>
<p>So what is a blockchain? What's in the word?</p>
<p>Nothing in the term “blockchain” presupposes the requirement to include a
nonce in the content so as to come up with a hash of so and so many leading
zeros. (This requirement is only there to be able to control the blockchain by
computing power and so, ultimately, by money.)</p>
<p>Nothing in the term “blockchain” presupposes the existence of a network, let
alone a decentralized one.</p>
<p>Nothing in the term “blockchain” presupposes any “independence” from “central
authority”.</p>
<p>The term “block chain” only presupposes blocks (of data) chained together. Now
what is a chain? Is it just a link? No, it is a <em>strong</em> link designed to hold
things together by force.</p>
<p>A simple linked list doesn't qualify as a blockchain because the contents of
the chunks of data in the list could be altered while the list would continue
to link back and forth just fine. This is not how a chain works.</p>
<p>To make a <em>link</em> of blocks of data into a <em>chain</em> of blocks of data, the
contents of the blocks need to be checksummed (digested) in one way or another
and this checksum (digest) must be part of the link, making it a strong link
protecting the content, preventing it from being altered. This is a
blockchain.</p>
<p>And this is what Git does, and hence Git is a blockchain, or works as one, if
you prefer.</p>
<p>To close the circle, let's ask again: <em>Why is Git not considered a “block
chain”?</em> It could be because many people, perhaps even a large majority, do
not focus on the essence of a concept but on blinking accidents.</p>

    <p>I'm transitioning from discretization of a continuous state space to function
approximation. My action and state space(3D) are both continuous. My problem
suffers majorly from errors due to aliasing and nearly no convergene after
training for a long time. Also I just cannot figure out how to choose the
right step size for discretization.</p>
<p>Reading Sutton &amp; Barto helped me understand the power of tile coding i.e
having the state space described by multiple offested tilings overlapping each
other. Given a continuous query/state, it is discribed by N basis functions,
each corresponding to a single block/square of the criss-cross tilings it
belongs to.</p>
<p>1) How is the performance different from going for a highly discretized state
space?</p>
<p>2) Can anyone please point me to a working example of tile coding in python? I
am learning too many things at the same time and getting super confused! (Q
learning, discretization dilemma, tile coding, function approximation and
handling the problem itself)</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any exhaustive Python coding tutorials for continuous
problems in RL.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>As the Simon's comment describes, a key difference between a highly
discretized state space and a function approximator using tile coding, it's
the hability of tile coding to generalize the values learned from one state to
other similar states (i.e., tiles can overlap). In the case of a highly
discretized state space, you need to visit all (and they can be a lot) the
states to obtain a good representation of the value function (or Q function).</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, in this link you can find an implementation of
tile coding (in C, C++, Lisp and Python) written by Rich Sutton and other
members of his laboratory.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Adding to Pablo's answer -</p>
<p>Tile coding (as a special case of coarse coding) can be compared to simple
state aggregation. A simple state aggregation is, for example, a grid. Tile
coding would be a stack of grids on top of each other, each shifted a bit from
the previous.</p>
<p>The benefits are two fold - it allows you to have <strong>better discrimination</strong>
(more fine grained control, less bias) <strong>without loss of generalization</strong>
(less variance).</p>
<p>This is because with tile coding <strong>you cover more states, with less
features</strong>.</p>
<p>A grid is similar to one-hot-encoding. A 3x3 grid is equivalent to a
9-Dimension 1-hot-encoding vector - and covers 10 states in total - either an
object is in one of the 9 grid blocks, or is in none of them.</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="images/Lo1y7.png"></p>
<p>So the middle point could be represented by (0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0).</p>
<p>How about you take 4 - 1x1 boxes, and just shift them a little bit 0.5 box (so
that they cover 2x2 area of the grid each).</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="images/KKZnv.png"></p>
<p>Now you cover 10 states with only 4 dimensions, or 4 inputs: red box, green
box, blue box, and purple box.</p>
<p>Now the same middle point could be represented by (1,1,1,1).</p>
<p>This means you can generalize better. Before - gradient descent would only
affect that middle point parameters. Now, since a point is influenced by a
combination of few features - all of these features parameters will be
affected. Which also allows for faster learning (as Pablo mentions).</p>
<p>Coursera offers (a paid) specialization which has exercises you need to
implement in Python. Specifically Course 3 week 3 let's you work with tiles.
They are using an <strong>updated</strong> (compared to Pablo's answer) Sutton's
implementation of the code, which is more simplified and uses python 3. Since
the code can be quite cryptic at first, here is my comments on it.</p>
