    <p>I've been involved with a lot of C-Programming and RT-Linux, now I want to do
some Artificial Neural Networking.</p>
<p><strong>BUT:</strong> How do I get started?</p>
<p>I'm also very interested in Evolutionary Algorithms(Learning Algorithms) and
Artificial Intelligence. Where can I start learning all of this?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>If you're just trying to get familiar with AI, then I would recommend that you
take the Stanford's free online courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.ai-class.com/</li>
<li>http://www.ml-class.org/course/auth/welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Get a good understanding of the ML/AI concepts and play with the algorithms.</p>
<p>Additional links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neural Network Example: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/evolved/nnt1.html</li>
<li>GP: http://www.genetic-programming.org/</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more resources online, but I think the above will give you a
decent start. Also, there are a LOT of similar questions on SO that provide
many useful links so I would recommend that you search for these topics on
stackoverflow.com:</p>

    <p>In any of the standard Reinforcement learning algorithms that use generalized
temporal differencing (e.g. SARSA, Q-learning), the question arises as to what
values to use for the lambda and gamma hyper-parameters for a specific task.</p>
<p>I understand that lambda is tied to the length of the eligibility traces and
gamma can be interpreted as how much to discount future rewards, but how do I
know when my lambda value is too low for a given task, or my gamma too high?</p>
<p>I realize these questions don't have well defined answers, but knowing some
'red flags' for having inappropriate values would be very useful.</p>
<p>Take the standard cart-pole, or inverted pendulum task for example. Should I
set gamma to be high, since it requires many steps to fail the task, or low
because the state information is completely Markovian? And I can't even fathom
rationals for lambda values...</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h3>Gamma</h3>
<p>Typically, gamma is viewed as part of the <em>problem</em> , not of the <em>algorithm</em>.
A reinforcement learning algorithm tries for each state to optimise the
cumulative discounted reward:</p>
<p><code>r1 + gamma*r2 + gamma^2*r3 + gamma^3*r4 ...</code></p>
<p>where <code>rn</code> is the reward received at time step <code>n</code> from the current state. So,
for one choice of gamma the algorithm may optimise one thing, and for another
choice it will optimise something else.</p>
<p>However, when you have defined a certain high-level goal, there still often
remains a modelling choice, as many different gamma's might satisfy the
requirements of the goal. For instance, in the cart pole the goal is to
balance the pole indefinitely. If you give a reward of +1 for every step that
it is balanced, the same policies (the ones that always balances the pole) are
optimal for all gamma &gt; 0. However, the ranking of suboptimal policies - that
determine the learning properties towards this goal - will be different for
different values of gamma.</p>
<p>In general, most algorithms learn faster when they don't have to look too far
into the future. So, it sometimes helps the performance to set gamma
relatively low. A general rule of thumb might be: determine the lowest gamma
<code>min_gamma</code> that still satisfies your high-level goal, and then set the gamma
to <code>gamma = (min_gamma + 1)/2</code>. (You don't want to use <code>gamma = min_gamma</code>
itself, since then some suboptimal goal will be deemed virtually as good as
the desired goal.) Another useful rule of thumb: for many problems a gamma of
0.9 or 0.95 is fine. However, always think about what such a gamma means for
the goal you are optimising when combined with your reward function.</p>
<h3>Lambda</h3>
<p>The lambda parameter determines how much you bootstrap on earlier learned
value versus using the current Monte Carlo roll-out. This implies a trade-off
between more bias (low lambda) and more variance (high lambda). In many cases,
setting lambda equal to zero is already a fine algorithm, but setting lambda
somewhat higher helps speed up things. Here, you do not have to worry about
what you are optimising: the goal is unrelated to lambda and this parameter
only helps to speed up learning. In other words, lambda is completely part of
the <em>algorithm</em> and not of the <em>problem</em>.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb is to use a lambda equal to 0.9. However, it might be
good just to try a few settings (e.g., 0, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95 and 1.0) and
plot the learning curves. Then, you can pick whichever seems to be learning
the fastest.</p>

    <p>I cannot pretend to begin to understand how AI software is created, but while
reading some news articles today the thought occurred to me: When does AI
become actual AI and not just complicated IF statements in the background? If
everything software does comes down to determinable IF statements with some
degree of randomness, how does it have any more or less AI than any other
program?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>AI doesn't "become" actual AI... It's the other way around, it stops being AI
when you figure out how it works.</p>
<p>Recommended reading: PoAIP</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When does AI become actual AI and not just complicated IF statements in the
background?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who says there's a difference? As far as we know, out brains are really just
"determinable IF statements with some degree of randomness" as well. Physics
is just applied math, chemistry is just phsyics with some details simplified
to allow working at a larger scale, biology is just simplified large-scale
chemistry, and so far we don't have any proof that psychology is not just
simplified large-scale biology.</p>
<blockquote>

other program?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emergent complexity - the whole is more than the sum of its parts and, as it
gets more complex, often shows behaviour that cannot be tracked down to any
one of the parts, or even specific groups of them.</p>
