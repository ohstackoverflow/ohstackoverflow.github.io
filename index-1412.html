    <p>I like to mess around with AI and wanted to try my hand at face recognition
the first step is to find the faces in the photographs. How is this usually
done? Do you use convolution of a sample image/images or statistics based
methods? How do you find the bounding box for the face? My goal is to classify
the pictures of my kids from all the digital photos.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Have a look at http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/ - you'll see that there are
a variety of ways of going about this.</p>
<p>Assuming you're wanting to code the whole thing yourself, you'll need to look
into Bayesian Frameworks, Neural Networks, possibly maths ones like Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the cool-named Elastic Bunch Graph Matching.</p>
<p>However it's worth noting that there are sooo many people who have coded this
around the world, that there are now ready to use, open source, off the shelf
apps, apis and libraries that you can simply call. Or neural networks you can
plug in - for example - TiNA.</p>
<p>Do a good bit of reading - it's a fascinating topic, and then decide whether
you want to go through reinventing the wheel (hey, it's fun to code, but it
may not be what you want to focus on) or whether you'll inherit and extend
some library or API.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <p>I have looked up what NEAT is on youtube and the internet, but I can only find
projects using NEAT, but apart from the wikipedia entry (which only says what
it is in introduction, and is very confusing), I still have no idea what it
is, is it a library, is it a type of neural network, is it a method of
training neural networks? Sorry if this is an obvious question.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>NEAT, or Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies, is a population-based
evolutionary algorithm introduced by Kenneth O'Stanley [1].</p>
<p>The algorithm is based on several key features:</p>
<p><strong>Complexification</strong></p>
<p>The networks in the initial population are the simplest possible (up to the
extreme of no connections at all, leaving the input and output neurons
unconnected) and the algorithm only <strong>adds</strong> new structural elements (neurons,
connections). This way, the resulting networks tend to be very small.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding competing conventions via historical markings</strong></p>
<p>In ordinary evolutionary algorithms it can easily happen that two individuals
encode the same (or very similar) behaviour but with very different genotype.
This is called <em>competing conventions</em>. When such individuals are subject to
crossover, their children are likely to be worse than either parent. NEAT
solves this by keeping historical markings of new structural elements. When a
new structural element is created (via structural mutation), it is assigned an
innovation number (and all such mutations that produced the same element, even
in different individuals are also assigned this same number). Then, when two
individuals are crossed over, their genotypes are aligned in such a way that
the corresponding innovation numbers match and only the differing elements are
exchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Speciation and fitness sharing</strong></p>
<p>NEAT works with the concept of <em>species</em>. That is simply a subdivision of the
population into several groups of individuals, called <em>species</em>. This
subdivision is based on the dissimilarity of the individuals that is computed
based on similar alignment of their genotypes as is used when doing crossover.
Probability of crossing over individuals from different species is then much
smaller than crossover inside species. By promoting the mating of more similar
parents, the children are less likely to be much worse than the parents
because the parents just were compatible.</p>
<p>Also, within the species, the fitness is shared among the individuals. This
serves two purposes. (1) It protects individuals from mutations - when a
mutation happens, the fitness would normally be low but because there is
fitness sharing, the individual has time to optimize itself (the weights) to
adapt to this new structural change. (2) Promotes diversity because the bigger
the species, the more is the fitness shared and the less fit are the members
of the species.</p>
<p>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend reading the original paper [1]. The algorithm is
described very well. Also there is a NEAT Users Page that has more links to
more papers and also implementations and uses of NEAT.</p>

    <p>I was wondering if you creative minds out there could think of some situations
or applications in the web environment where Neural Networks would be suitable
or an interesting spin.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some great ideas here. I was thinking more web centric. Maybe bot
detectors or AI in games.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any type of recommendation system (whether it's movies, books, or targeted advertisement)</li>
<li>Systems where you want to adapt behaviour to user preferences (spam detection, for example)</li>
<li>Recognition tasks (intrusion detection)</li>
<li>Computer Vision oriented tasks (image classification for search engines and indexers, specific objects detection)</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing tasks (document/article classification, again search engines and the like)</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The game located at 20q.net is one of my favorite web-based neural networks.
You could adapt this idea to create a learning system that knows how to play a
simple game and slowly learns how to beat humans at it. As it plays human
opponents, it records data on game situations, the actions taken, and whether
or not the NN won the game. Every time it plays, win or lose, it gets a little
better. (Note: don't try this with too simple of a game like checkers, an
overly simple game can have every possible game/combination of moves pre-
computed which defeats the purpose of using the NN).</p>
<p>Any sort of classification system based on multiple criteria might be worth
looking at. I have heard of some company developing a NN that looks at
employee records and determines which ones are the least satisfied or the most
likely to quit.</p>
<p>Neural networks are also good for doing certain types of language processing,
including OCR or converting text to speech. Try creating a system that can
decipher capchas, either from the graphical representation or the audio
representation.</p>
