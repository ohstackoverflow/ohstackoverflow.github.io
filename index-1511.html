    <p>I need to get the Chainlink prices of a token from a specific time to the most
recent round. This time varies based on user input but will be relatively
short windows (1 day to 2 weeks max) based on the heartbeat of the token. This
is used to calculate the price of a payout both in the smart contract and on
the application homepage.</p>
<p>To get historical price data Chainlink needs a 'roundId' which is a non-
incremental value.</p>
<p>What is the best way to either get all roundIds for the given time window from
Chainlink or record them in a way that is open, decentralised and can be
accessed in a solidity smart contract?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Each proxy contract for a Chainlink Price Feed can have multiple underlying
aggregator contracts, with one of them being set as the 'active' one at any
given instance. Ie whenever the Chainlink Labs team deploys new versions of
the aggregator, they update the proxy contract to set the current aggregator
version to be the new one, and all new price data starts getting written to
the new aggregator.</p>
<p>Based on this, if you want historical price data for a proxy contract/price
pair from the last couple weeks or so, you'd need to go to the current
aggregator for the proxy contract, then get the current round info (including
timestamp), then go back in aggregator rounds in a loop until you get to a
round that is less than your search parameter timestamp.</p>
<p>To find the current aggregator contract address for a proxy contract, you can
call the <code>aggregator</code> getter function in the proxy contract.</p>
<p>The phase ID can be thought of as an incrementing ID number that the proxy
contract uses to identify each aggregator as it gets added to the proxy, so
the first one is 1, second is 2 etc. To find out what the current phase ID is
of the current aggregator, you can use the <em>phaseId</em> getter function in the
proxy contract.</p>
<p>Aggregator round IDs start from 1 and increase by 1 each time. Eg you can use
the aggregator <code>latestRound</code> getter function to find the last round that it
stored, and then start from that number as an input parameter to
<code>getRoundData</code>, and then reduce the number by one and loop through until you
reach your point in time.</p>
<p>Unlike Aggregator round IDs, proxy round IDs are those big really long numbers
like <code>36893488147419113293</code>, and are actually just a derived value based on
the aggregator phase ID and the aggregator round ID. This is done to ensure
the proxy round IDs are always increasing in value, and that there will never
be any overlap between the same rounds across different aggregators, eg round
5000 from aggregator with phase ID 1 should have a lower proxy round ID that
round 5000 from aggregator with phase ID 2</p>
<p>In Solidity you can easily replicate the proxy round ID derived value with the
following formula, passing in the phase ID of the aggregator and the
aggregator round ID</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">uint80</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">uint256</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_phaseId</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">64</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">_aggregatorRoundId</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can even then take that derived value and pass it into the proxy contract
<code>getRoundData</code> function, and get the same data result as calling
<code>getRoundData</code> in the aggregator contract for the given aggregator round ID.</p>
<p>I find A good way to play around with these is to interact with the functions
directly on etherescan, and see the data returned. Ie here's the Kovan ETH/USD
proxy and its latest aggregator</p>
<p>Regarding the answer your second question, the best way is to start from
'now', ie get the latest aggregator, grab the latest round in the aggregator
and then go back in time by reducing the aggregator round ID by 1, and
continue to get pricing info until the round timestamp is &lt; your search
timestamp.</p>
<p>Finally, looping in Solidity is not very gas efficient. Another approach you
can take is to off-load the external computation to an oracle, and the oracle
can give you the correct round ID, and you can then take that and verify the
results on-chain. Here's an example of that design pattern in the form of an
external adapter that retrieves historical price data based on a timestamp.
There is a live version of this running on Kovan too, check out the readme for
more info</p>

    <p>I have got this example https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles run locally.
I saw that the example downloaded the golang chaincode from
https://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles-chaincode. And the chaincode was
stored on harddisk at /marbles/node_modules/ibm-blockchain-js/temp/unzip.
Could you please explain how the golang chaincode was executed inside the
nodejs code?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I haven't looked at the Marbles app in detail, but generally speaking, the
nodejs code is just a client to the validator network, and the validator is
processing the golang based chaincode in a way that is completely decoupled
from the nodejs based client. In this process, the validator
downloads/acquires the chaincode and compiles it locally within an isolating
container. You could look at the process like
[golang::chaincode]-&gt;[nodejs::client]-&gt;(network)-&gt;[golang::validator]-&gt;[golang::container].
So the first and last parts are golang/chaincode related, the stuff that
happens in the middle is more or less a transport. I.e. the fact that the
client is nodejs and the validator is golang matter little here.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The Golang code that implements the Marbles chaincode (aka smart contract)
does not get executed inside the Node.js app. The chaincode is what the
application interacts with to modify state variables stored in the blockchain.
State in this case is: what marbles exist, who their owner is, what color it
is, etc. But the chaincode itself (the Golang code) is packaged as a docker
container, deployed to the blockchain, and is up and running waiting for
transactions. The Node.js code constructs and sends these transactions to the
docker container, receives results of the chaincode execution, and updates the
application view of the current state.</p>
<p>Just FYI, the Marbles app was implemented to demonstrate how to implement an
application running on top of the Hyperledger Fabric project. Hyperledger
currently only fully supports Golang as it's smart contract language, but more
languages are coming soon.</p>

    <p>I have developed a chaincode using this and now that I know that it works I
want to test it in a network with multiple nodes.</p>
<p>Where should I put my chaincode so that I can deploy it in the Hyperledger
fabric network?</p>
<p>I have used this to setup the network.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There are two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are not using a docker image to start your nodes then you should deploy the chaincode by specifying a fully qualified path, in other words, you should set the parameter when deploying:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>-p /home/user/my/awesome/chaincode</code></p>
<ol>
<li>If you are running your nodes/peers in a docker image (like the instructions you are following to setup a development network) then you have two options:</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>first one</strong> is to put your chaincode inside a folder in the path
<code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer</code>. Then you can build your
image (<code>go test -run BuildImage_Peer</code>).</p>
<p>Now the docker image will have the chaincode in its filesystem (you can check
it by navigating in it by using <code>docker run --rm -it -e
CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=http://172.17.0.1:2375 -e CORE_PEER_ID=vp0 -e
CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true hyperledger-peer /bin/bash</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, to deploy the chaincode you have to set the path (parameter -p) to
the folder that contains your chaincode, relative to <code>$GOPATH/src/</code>. This path
would be: <code>github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/yourfolderwiththecc</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>second option</strong> is similar (not tested yet), but it uses a shared
filesystem between docker and vagrant to access the chaincode. The idea is to
run the docker with something like <code>-v local-dev:localdev</code>, so that local-dev
folder in the docker image is linked to vagrant's local-dev folder (where you
should put your chaincode) and with <code>-e GOPATH=/local-dev</code> you set the GOPATH
so that the relative path can start from the /local-dev folder.</p>
<p>Observation: the path with github.com might be confusing because it seems that
it is getting the chaincode from Github, but it is just the folder name.</p>
<p>Important: to deploy a chaincode, only one peer needs to have available the
chaincode file (the one where the deploy is sent), as the consensus is
responsible of broadcasting the chaincode.</p>
