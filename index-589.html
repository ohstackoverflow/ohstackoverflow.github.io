    <p>When I start a new ASP.NET project in Visual Studio, I can create an ASP.NET
Web Application or I can create an ASP.NET Web Site.</p>
<p>What is the difference between ASP.NET Web Application and ASP.NET Web Site?
Why would I choose one over other?</p>
<p>Is the answer different based on which version of Visual Studio I am using?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>Website:</h4>
<p>The <em>Web Site</em> project is compiled on the fly. You end up with a lot more DLL
files, which can be a pain. It also gives problems when you have pages or
controls in one directory that need to reference pages and controls in another
directory since the other directory may not be compiled into the code yet.
Another problem can be in publishing.</p>
<p>If Visual Studio isn't told to re-use the same names constantly, it will come
up with new names for the DLL files generated by pages all the time. That can
lead to having several close copies of DLL files containing the same class
name, which will generate plenty of errors. The Web Site project was
introduced with Visual Studio 2005, but it has turned out not to be popular.</p>
<h4>Web Application:</h4>
<p>The <em>Web Application</em> Project was created as an add-in and now exists as part
of SP 1 for Visual Studio 2005. The main differences are the Web Application
Project was designed to work similarly to the Web projects that shipped with
Visual Studio 2003. It will compile the application into a single DLL file at
build time. To update the project, it must be recompiled and the DLL file
published for changes to occur.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of the Web Application project is it's much easier to
exclude files from the project view. In the Web Site project, each file that
you exclude is renamed with an excluded keyword in the filename. In the Web
Application Project, the project just keeps track of which files to
include/exclude from the project view without renaming them, making things
much tidier.</p>
<p><em>Reference</em></p>
<p>The article <em>ASP.NET 2.0 - Web Site vs Web Application project</em> also gives
reasons on why to use one and not the other. Here is an excerpt of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You need to migrate large Visual Studio .NET 2003 applications to VS
2005? <strong>use the Web Application project.</strong>
</li>
<li>You want to open and edit any directory as a Web project without
creating a project file? <strong>use Web Site project.</strong>
</li>
<li>You need to add pre-build and post-build steps during compilation? <strong>use
Web Application project.</strong>
</li>
<li>You need to build a Web application using multiple Web projects? <strong>use
the Web Application project.</strong>
</li>
<li>You want to generate one assembly for each page? <strong>use the Web Site
project.</strong>
</li>
<li>You prefer dynamic compilation and working on pages without building
entire site on each page view? <strong>use Web Site project.</strong>
</li>
<li>You prefer single-page code model to code-behind model? <strong>use Web Site
project.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Web Application Projects versus Web Site Projects</em> (MSDN) explains the
differences between the web site and web application projects. Also, it
discusses the configuration to be made in Visual Studio.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Web Site</strong> is what you deploy to an ASP.NET web server such as IIS. Just a
bunch of files and folders. There’s nothing in a Web Site that ties you to
Visual Studio (there’s no project file). Code-generation and compilation of
web pages (such as .aspx, .ascx, .master) is done dynamically at runtime, and
changes to these files are detected by the framework and automatically re-
compiled. You can put code that you want to share between pages in the special
App_Code folder, or you can pre-compile it and put the assembly in the Bin
folder.</p>
<p><strong>Web Application</strong> is a special Visual Studio project. <strong>The main difference
with Web Sites is that when you build the project all the code files are
compiled into a single assembly, which is placed in the bin directory. You
don’t deploy code files to the web server.</strong> Instead of having a special
folder for shared code files you can put them anywhere, just like you would do
in class library. Because Web Applications contains files that are not meant
to be deployed, such as project and code files, there’s a Publish command in
Visual Studio to output a Web Site to a specified location.</p>
<h3>App_Code vs Bin</h3>
<p>Deploying shared code files is generally a bad idea, but that doesn’t mean you
have to choose Web Application. You can have a Web Site that references a
class library project that holds all the code for the Web Site. Web
Applications is just a convenient way to do it.</p>
<h3>CodeBehind</h3>
<p><em>This topic is specific to .aspx and .ascx files. This topic is decreasingly
relevant in new application frameworks such as ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web
Pages which do not use codebehind files.</em></p>
<p>By having all code files compiled into a single assembly, including codebehind
files of .aspx pages and .ascx controls, in Web Applications you have to re-
build for every little change, and you cannot make live changes. This can be a
real pain during development, since you have to keep re-building to see the
changes, while with Web Sites changes are detected by the runtime and
pages/controls are automatically recompiled.</p>
<p>Having the runtime manage the codebehind assemblies is less work for you,
since you don't need to worry about giving pages/controls unique names, or
organizing them into different namespaces.</p>
<p>I’m not saying deploying code files is always a good idea (specially not in
the case of shared code files), but codebehind files should only contain code
that perform UI specific tasks, wire-up events handlers, etc. Your application
should be layered so that important code always end up in the Bin folder. If
that is the case then deploying codebehind files shouldn't be considered
harmful.</p>
<p>Another limitation of Web Applications is that you can only use the language
of the project. In Web Sites you can have some pages in C#, some in VB, etc.
No need for special Visual Studio support. That’s the beauty of the build
provider extensibility.</p>
<p>Also, in Web Applications you don't get error detection in pages/controls as
the compiler only compiles your codebehind classes and not the markup code (in
MVC you can fix this using the MvcBuildViews option), which is compiled at
runtime.</p>
<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Because Web Applications are Visual Studio projects you get some features not
available in Web Sites. For instance, you can use build events to perform a
variety of tasks, e.g. minify and/or combine Javascript files.</p>
<p>Another nice feature introduced in Visual Studio 2010 is Web.config
transformation. <del>This is also not available in Web Sites.</del> Now works with
Web Sites in VS 2013.</p>
<p>Building a Web Application is faster than building a Web Site, specially for
large sites. This is mainly because Web Applications do not compile the markup
code. In MVC if you set MvcBuildViews to true then it compiles the markup code
and you get error detection, which is very useful. The down side is that every
time you build the solution it builds the complete site, which can be slow and
inefficient, specially if you are not editing the site. l find myself turning
MvcBuildViews on and off (which requires a project unload). On the other hand,
with Web Sites you can choose if you want to build the site as part of the
solution or not. If you choose not to, then building the solution is very
fast, and you can always click on the Web Site node and select Build, if
you’ve made changes.</p>
<p>In an MVC Web Application project you have extra commands and dialogs for
common tasks, like ‘Add View’, ‘Go To View’, ‘Add Controller’, etc. These are
not available in an MVC Web Site.</p>
<p>If you use IIS Express as the development server, in Web Sites you can add
virtual directories. This option is not available in Web Applications.</p>
<p><del>NuGet Package Restore does not work on Web Sites, you have to manually
install packages listed on packages.config</del> Package Restore now works with
Web Sites starting NuGet 2.7</p>

    <p>I have the branch <code>master</code> which tracks the remote branch <code>origin/master</code>.</p>
<p>I want to rename them to <code>master-old</code> both locally and on the remote. Is this
possible?</p>
<p>For other users who tracked <code>origin/master</code> (and who always updated their
local <code>master</code> branch via <code>git pull</code>), what would happen after I renamed the
remote branch?<br>
Would their <code>git pull</code> still work or would it throw an error that it couldn't
find <code>origin/master</code> anymore?</p>
<p>Then, further on, I want to create a new <code>master</code> branch (both locally and
remote). Again, after I did this, what would happen now if the other users do
<code>git pull</code>?</p>
<p>I guess all this would result in a lot of trouble. Is there a clean way to get
what I want? Or should I just leave <code>master</code> as it is and create a new branch
<code>master-new</code> and just work there further on?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The closest thing to renaming is deleting and then recreating on the remote.
For example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git branch -m master master-old
git push remote :master         # Delete master
git push remote master-old      # Create master-old on remote

git checkout -b master some-ref # Create a new local master
git push remote master          # Create master on remote
</pre></div>

<p>However, this has a lot of caveats. First, no existing checkouts will know
about the rename - Git does <em>not</em> attempt to track branch renames. If the new
<code>master</code> doesn't exist yet, <em>git pull</em> will error out. If the new <code>master</code> has
been created. the pull will attempt to merge <code>master</code> and <code>master-old</code>. So
it's generally a bad idea unless you have the cooperation of everyone who has
checked out the repository previously.</p>
<p>Note: Newer versions of Git will not allow you to delete the master branch
remotely by default. You can override this by setting the
<code>receive.denyDeleteCurrent</code> configuration value to <code>warn</code> or <code>ignore</code> on the
<em>remote</em> repository. Otherwise, if you're ready to create a new master right
away, skip the <code>git push remote :master</code> step, and pass <code>--force</code> to the <code>git
push remote master</code> step. Note that if you're not able to change the remote's
configuration, you won't be able to completely delete the master branch!</p>
<p>This caveat only applies to the current branch (usually the <code>master</code> branch);
any other branch can be deleted and recreated as above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Assuming you are currently on <code>master</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git push origin master:master-old        # 1
git branch master-old origin/master-old  # 2
git reset --hard $new_master_commit      # 3
git push -f origin                       # 4
</pre></div>

<ol>
<li>First make a <code>master-old</code> branch in the <code>origin</code> repository, based off of the <code>master</code> commit in the local repository.</li>
<li>Create a new local branch for this new <code>origin/master-old</code> branch (which will automatically be set up properly as a tracking branch).</li>
<li>Now point your local <code>master</code> to whichever commit you want it to point to.</li>
<li>Finally, force-change <code>master</code> in the <code>origin</code> repository to reflect your new local <code>master</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(If you do it in any other way, you need at least one more step to ensure that
<code>master-old</code> is properly set up to track <code>origin/master-old</code>. None of the
other solutions posted at the time of this writing include that.)</p>
