why this is happening?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Cygwin uses persistent shared memory sections, which can on occasion become
corrupted. The symptom of this is that some Cygwin programs begin to fail, but
other applications are unaffected. Since these shared memory sections are
persistent, often a <strong>system reboot</strong> is needed to clear them out before the
problem can be resolved.</p>

    <p>Why do comparisons of NaN values behave differently from all other values?
That is, all comparisons with the operators ==, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;, &gt; where one or both
values is NaN returns false, contrary to the behaviour of all other values.</p>
<p>I suppose this simplifies numerical computations in some way, but I couldn't
find an explicitly stated reason, not even in the Lecture Notes on the Status
of IEEE 754 by Kahan which discusses other design decisions in detail.</p>
<p>This deviant behavior is causing trouble when doing simple data processing.
For example, when sorting a list of records w.r.t. some real-valued field in a
C program I need to write extra code to handle NaN as the maximal element,
otherwise the sort algorithm could become confused.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The answers so far all argue that it is meaningless to compare NaNs.</p>
<p>I agree, but that doesn't mean that the correct answer is false, rather it
would be a Not-a-Boolean (NaB), which fortunately doesn't exist.</p>
<p>So the choice of returning true or false for comparisons is in my view
arbitrary, and for general data processing it would be advantageous if it
obeyed the usual laws (reflexivity of ==, trichotomy of &lt;, ==, &gt;), lest data
structures which rely on these laws become confused.</p>
<p>So I'm asking for some concrete advantage of breaking these laws, not just
philosophical reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I think I understand now why making NaN maximal would be a bad
idea, it would mess up the computation of upper limits.</p>
<p>NaN != NaN might be desirable to avoid detecting convergence in a loop such as</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">!=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">oldX</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">oldX</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="c1">;</span>

}
</pre></div>

<p>which however should better be written by comparing the absolute difference
with a small limit. So IMHO this is a relatively weak argument for breaking
reflexivity at NaN.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I was a member of the IEEE-754 committee, I'll try to help clarify things a
bit.</p>
<p>First off, floating-point numbers are not real numbers, and floating-point
arithmetic does not satisfy the axioms of real arithmetic. Trichotomy is not
the only property of real arithmetic that does not hold for floats, nor even
the most important. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition is not associative.</li>
<li>The distributive law does not hold.</li>
<li>There are floating-point numbers without inverses.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on. It is not possible to specify a fixed-size arithmetic type that
satisfies <em>all</em> of the properties of real arithmetic that we know and love.
The 754 committee has to decide to bend or break some of them. This is guided
by some pretty simple principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we can, we match the behavior of real arithmetic.</li>
<li>When we can't, we try to make the violations as predictable and as easy to diagnose as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding your comment "that doesn't mean that the correct answer is false",
this is wrong. The predicate <code>(y &lt; x)</code> asks whether <code>y</code> is less than <code>x</code>. If
<code>y</code> is NaN, then it is <em>not</em> less than any floating-point value <code>x</code>, so the
answer is necessarily false.</p>
<p>I mentioned that trichotomy does not hold for floating-point values. However,
there is a similar property that does hold. Clause 5.11, paragraph 2 of the
754-2008 standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four mutually exclusive relations are possible: less than, equal, greater
than, and unordered. The last case arises when at least one operand is NaN.
Every NaN shall compare unordered with everything, including itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as writing extra code to handle NaNs goes, it is usually possible
(though not always easy) to structure your code in such a way that NaNs fall
through properly, but this is not always the case. When it isn't, some extra
code may be necessary, but that's a small price to pay for the convenience
that algebraic closure brought to floating-point arithmetic.</p>
<hr>
<p>Addendum: Many commenters have argued that it would be more useful to preserve
reflexivity of equality and trichotomy on the grounds that adopting NaN != NaN
doesn’t seem to preserve any familiar axiom. I confess to having some sympathy
for this viewpoint, so I thought I would revisit this answer and provide a bit
more context.</p>
<p>My understanding from talking to Kahan is that NaN != NaN originated out of
two pragmatic considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That <code>x == y</code> should be equivalent to <code>x - y == 0</code> whenever possible (beyond being a theorem of real arithmetic, this makes hardware implementation of comparison more space-efficient, which was of utmost importance at the time the standard was developed — note, however, that this is violated for x = y = infinity, so it’s not a great reason on its own; it could have reasonably been bent to <code>(x - y == 0) or (x and y are both NaN)</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More importantly, there was no <code>isnan( )</code> predicate at the time that NaN was formalized in the 8087 arithmetic; it was necessary to provide programmers with a convenient and efficient means of detecting NaN values that didn’t depend on programming languages providing something like <code>isnan( )</code> which could take many years. I’ll quote Kahan’s own writing on the subject:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Were there no way to get rid of NaNs, they would be as useless as
Indefinites on CRAYs; as soon as one were encountered, computation would be
best stopped rather than continued for an indefinite time to an Indefinite
conclusion. That is why some operations upon NaNs must deliver non-NaN
results. Which operations? … The exceptions are C predicates “ x == x ” and
“ x != x ”, which are respectively 1 and 0 for every infinite or finite
number x but reverse if x is Not a Number ( NaN ); these provide the only
simple unexceptional distinction between NaNs and numbers in languages that
lack a word for NaN and a predicate IsNaN(x).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this is also the logic that rules out returning something like a
“Not-A-Boolean”. Maybe this pragmatism was misplaced, and the standard should
have required <code>isnan( )</code>, but that would have made NaN nearly impossible to
use efficiently and conveniently for several years while the world waited for
programming language adoption. I’m not convinced that would have been a
reasonable tradeoff.</p>
<p>To be blunt: the result of NaN == NaN isn’t going to change now. Better to
learn to live with it than to complain on the internet. If you want to argue
that an order relation suitable for containers should <em>also</em> exist, I would
recommend advocating that your favorite programming language implement the
<code>totalOrder</code> predicate standardized in IEEE-754 (2008). The fact that it
hasn’t already speaks to the validity of Kahan’s concern that motivated the
current state of affairs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>NaN can be thought of as an undefined state/number. similar to the concept of
0/0 being undefined or sqrt(-3) (in the real number system where the floating
point lives).</p>
<p>NaN is used as a sort of placeholder for this undefined state. Mathematically
speaking, undefined is not equal to undefined. Neither can you say an
undefined value is greater or less than another undefined value. Therefore all
comparisons return false.</p>
<p>This behaviour is also advantageous in the cases where you compare sqrt(-3) to
sqrt(-2). They would both return NaN but they are not equivalent even though
they return the same value. Therefore having equality always returning false
when dealing with NaN is the desired behaviour.</p>

    <p>I have an application that use managed dlls. One of those dlls return a
generic dictionary:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; MyDictionary;
</pre></div>

<p>The dictionary contains keys with upper and lower case.</p>
<p>On another side I am getting a list of potential keys (string) however I
cannot guarantee the case. I am trying to get the value in the dictionary
using the keys. But of course the following will fail since I have a case
mismatch:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">bool Success = MyDictionary.TryGetValue( MyIndex, out TheValue );
</pre></div>

<p>I was hoping the TryGetValue would have an <em>ignore case</em> flag like mentioned
in the MSDN doc, but it seems this is not valid for generic dictionaries.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the value of that dictionary ignoring the key case? Is
there a better workaround than creating a new copy of the dictionary with the
proper <em>StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase</em> parameter?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There's no way to specify a <code>StringComparer</code> at the point where you try to get
a value. If you think about it, <code>"foo".GetHashCode()</code> and
<code>"FOO".GetHashCode()</code> are totally different so there's no reasonable way you
could implement a case-insensitive get on a case-sensitive hash map.</p>
<p>You can, however, create a case-insensitive dictionary in the first place
using:-</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">comparer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">StringComparer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">OrdinalIgnoreCase</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">caseInsensitiveDictionary</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb nb-Type">Dictionary</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb nb-Type">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">comparer</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or create a new case-insensitive dictionary with the contents of an existing
case-sensitive dictionary (if you're sure there are no case collisions):-</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">oldDictionary</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">comparer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">StringComparer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">OrdinalIgnoreCase</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">newDictionary</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb nb-Type">Dictionary</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb nb-Type">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">oldDictionary</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">comparer</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This new dictionary then uses the <code>GetHashCode()</code> implementation on
<code>StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase</code> so <code>comparer.GetHashCode("foo")</code> and
<code>comparer.GetHashcode("FOO")</code> give you the same value.</p>
<p>Alternately, if there are only a few elements in the dictionary, and/or you
only need to lookup once or twice, you can treat the original dictionary as an
<code>IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt;</code> and just iterate over it:-</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">myKey</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">myDictionary</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">comparer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">StringComparer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">OrdinalIgnoreCase</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">myDictionary</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FirstOrDefault</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb nb-Type">String</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Equals</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Key</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">myKey</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">comparer</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Value</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or if you prefer, without the LINQ:-</p>
