    <p>Given that strings are immutable in .NET, I'm wondering why they have been
designed such that <code>string.Substring()</code> takes O(<code>substring.Length</code>) time,
instead of <code>O(1)</code>?</p>
<p>i.e. what were the tradeoffs, if any?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>UPDATE: I liked this question so much, I just blogged it. See Strings,
immutability and persistence</p>
<hr>
<p>The short answer is: <strong>O(n) is O(1) if n does not grow large.</strong> Most people
extract tiny substrings from tiny strings, so how the complexity grows
asymptotically is <em>completely irrelevant</em>.</p>
<p>The long answer is:</p>
<p>An immutable data structure built such that operations on an instance permit
re-use of the memory of the original with only a small amount (typically O(1)
or O(lg n)) of copying or new allocation is called a "persistent" immutable
data structure. Strings in .NET are immutable; your question is essentially
"why are they not persistent"?</p>
<p>Because when you look at operations that are <em>typically</em> done on strings in
.NET programs, it is in every relevant way <em>hardly worse at all</em> to simply
make an entirely new string. <strong>The expense and difficulty of building a
complex persistent data structure doesn't pay for itself.</strong></p>
<p>People typically use "substring" to extract a short string -- say, ten or
twenty characters -- out of a somewhat longer string -- maybe a couple hundred
characters. You have a line of text in a comma-separated file and you want to
extract the third field, which is a last name. The line will be maybe a couple
hundred characters long, the name will be a couple dozen. String allocation
and memory copying of fifty bytes is <em>astonishingly fast</em> on modern hardware.
That making a new data structure that consists of a pointer to the middle of
an existing string plus a length is <em>also</em> astonishingly fast is irrelevant;
"fast enough" is by definition fast enough.</p>
<p>The substrings extracted are typically small in size and short in lifetime;
the garbage collector is going to reclaim them soon, and they didn't take up
much room on the heap in the first place. So using a persistent strategy that
encourages reuse of most of the memory is also not a win; all you've done is
made your garbage collector get slower because now it has to worry about
handling interior pointers.</p>
<p>If the substring operations people typically did on strings were completely
different, then it would make sense to go with a persistent approach. If
people typically had million-character strings, and were extracting thousands
of overlapping substrings with sizes in the hundred-thousand-character range,
and those substrings lived a long time on the heap, then it would make perfect
sense to go with a persistent substring approach; it would be wasteful and
foolish not to. But <strong>most line-of-business programmers do not do anything
even vaguely like those sorts of things</strong>. .NET is not a platform that is
tailored for the needs of the Human Genome Project; DNA analysis programmers
have to solve problems with those string usage characteristics every day; odds
are good that you do not. The few who do build their own persistent data
structures that closely match <em>their</em> usage scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, my team writes programs that do on-the-fly analysis of C# and VB
code as you type it. Some of those code files are <em>enormous</em> and thus we
cannot be doing O(n) string manipulation to extract substrings or insert or
delete characters. We have built a bunch of persistent immutable data
structures for representing edits to a text buffer that permit us to quickly
and efficiently re-use the bulk of the existing string data <em>and</em> the existing
lexical and syntactic analyses upon a typical edit. This was a hard problem to
solve and its solution was narrowly tailored to the specific domain of C# and
VB code editing. It would be unrealistic to expect the built-in string type to
solve this problem for us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Precisely <em>because</em> Strings are immutable, <code>.Substring</code> must make a copy of at
least a portion of the original string. Making a copy of <em>n</em> bytes should take
O(n) time.</p>
<p>How do you think you would copy a bunch of bytes in <em>constant</em> time?</p>
<hr>
<p>EDIT: Mehrdad suggests not copying the string at all, but keeping a reference
to a piece of it.</p>
<p>Consider in .Net, a multi-megabyte string, on which someone calls
<code>.SubString(n, n+3)</code> (for any n in the middle of the string).</p>
<p>Now, the ENTIRE string cannot be Garbage Collected just because one reference
is holding on to 4 characters? That seems like a ridiculous waste of space.</p>
<p>Further, tracking references to substrings (which may even be inside
substrings), and trying to copy at optimal times to avoid defeating the GC (as
described above), makes the concept a nightmare. It is far simpler, and more
reliable, to copy on <code>.SubString</code>, and maintain the straightforward immutable
model.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's a <strong>good little read</strong> about the danger of keeping references
to substrings within larger strings.</p>

    <p>I want git to list all tags along with the full annotation or commit message.
Something like this is close:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git tag -n5
</pre></div>

<p>This does exactly what I want except that it will only show up to the first 5
lines of the tag message.</p>
<p>I guess I can just use a very large number. What is the highest number I can
use here? Is it the same on every computer?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> : I have had much time to think about this, and now I think I don't
necessarily want to show the entirety of each message if some of them are
extraordinarily long. I didn't really have any particular need that required
me to see massive messages (other than my own propensity to be long winded in
everything I write, including tag messages). I just didn't like the idea that
it was not necessarily going to show me the whole message, as that made me
feel like it was hiding information from me. But too much information can also
be a bad thing.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git tag -n99
</pre></div>

<p>Short and sweet. This will list up to 99 lines from each tag annotation/commit
message. Here is a link to the official documentation for git tag.</p>
<p>I now think the limitation of only showing up to 99 lines per tag is actually
a good thing as most of the time, if there were really more than 99 lines for
a single tag, you wouldn't really want to see all the rest of the lines would
you? If you did want to see more than 99 lines per tag, you could always
increase this to a larger number.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess there could be a specific situation or reason to want to see
massive tag messages, but at what point do you <strong>not</strong> want to see the whole
message? When it has more than 999 lines? 10,000? 1,000,000? My point is, it
typically makes sense to have a cap on how many lines you would see, and this
number allows you to set that.</p>
<p>Since I am making an argument for what you generally want to see when looking
at your tags, it probably makes sense to set something like this as an alias
(from Iulian Onofrei's comment below):</p>
<p><code>git config --global alias.tags 'tag -n99'</code></p>
<p>I mean, you don't really want to have to type in <code>git tag -n99</code> every time you
just want to see your tags do you? Once that alias is configured, whenever you
want to see your tags, you would just type <code>git tags</code> into your terminal.
Personally, I prefer to take things a step further than this and create even
more abbreviated bash aliases for all my commonly used commands. For that
purpose, you could add something like this to your .bashrc file (works on
Linux and similar environments):</p>
<p><code>alias gtag='git tag -n99'</code></p>
<p>Then whenever you want to see your tags, you just type <code>gtag</code>. Another
advantage of going down the alias path (either git aliases or bash aliases or
whatever) is you now have a spot already in place where you can add further
customizations to how you personally, generally want to have your tags shown
to you (like sorting them in certain ways as in my comment below, etc). Once
you get over the hurtle of creating your first alias, you will now realize how
easy it is to create more of them for other things you like to work in a
customized way, like <code>git log</code>, but let's save that one for a different
question/answer.</p>

<p>Use <code>re.findall</code> or <code>re.finditer</code> instead.</p>
