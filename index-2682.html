    <p>We have a project in Team Foundation Server (TFS) that has a non-English
character (š) in it. When trying to script a few build-related things we've
stumbled upon a problem - we can't pass the <strong>š</strong> letter to the command-line
tools. The command prompt or what not else messes it up, and the <strong>tf.exe</strong>
utility can't find the specified project.</p>
<p>I've tried different formats for the .bat file (ANSI, UTF-8 with and without
BOM) as well as scripting it in JavaScript (which is Unicode inherently) - but
no luck. How do I execute a program and pass it a <strong>Unicode</strong> command line?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>My background: I use Unicode input/output in a console for years (and do it a
lot daily. Moreover, I develop support tools for exactly this task). There are
very few problems, as far as you understand the following facts/limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>CMD</code> and “console” are unrelated factors. <code>CMD.exe</code> is a just one of programs which are ready to “work inside” a console (“console applications”).</li>
<li>AFAIK, <code>CMD</code> has perfect support for Unicode; you can enter/output all Unicode chars when <em>any</em> codepage is active. </li>
<li>Windows’ console has A LOT of support for Unicode — but it is not perfect (just “good enough”; see below).</li>
<li>
<code>chcp 65001</code> is very dangerous. Unless a program was specially designed to work around defects in the Windows’ API (or uses a C runtime library which has these workarounds), it would not work reliably. Win8 fixes ½ of these problems with <code>cp65001</code>, but the rest is still applicable to Win10.</li>
<li>I work in <code>cp1252</code>. As I already said: <strong>To input/output Unicode in a console, one does not need to set the codepage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The details</h2>
<ul>
<li>To read/write Unicode to a console, an application (or its C runtime library) should be smart enough to use not <code>File-I/O</code> API, but <code>Console-I/O</code> API. (For an example, see how Python does it.)</li>
<li>Likewise, to read Unicode command-line arguments, an application (or its C runtime library) should be smart enough to use the corresponding API.</li>
<li>Console font rendering supports only Unicode characters in BMP (in other words: below <code>U+10000</code>). Only simple text rendering is supported (so European — and some East Asian — languages should work fine — as far as one uses precomposed forms). [There is a minor fine print here for East Asian and for characters U+0000, U+0001, U+30FB.]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Practical considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>defaults</strong> on Window are not very helpful. For best experience, one should tune up 3 pieces of configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>For output: a comprehensive console font. For best results, I recommend my builds. (The installation instructions are present there — and also listed in other answers on this page.)</li>
<li>For input: a capable keyboard layout. For best results, I recommend my layouts.</li>
<li>For input: allow HEX input of Unicode.</li>
<li>
<p>One more gotcha with “Pasting” into a console application (very technical):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEX input delivers a character on <code>KeyUp</code> of <code>Alt</code>; <em>all</em> the other ways to deliver a character happen on <code>KeyDown</code>; so many applications are not ready to see a character on <code>KeyUp</code>. (Only applicable to applications using <code>Console-I/O</code> API.)</p>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: many application would not react on HEX input events.</li>
<li>Moreover, what happens with a “Pasted” character depends on the current keyboard layout: if the character can be typed without using prefix keys (but with arbitrary complicated combination of modifiers, as in <code>Ctrl-Alt-AltGr-Kana-Shift-Gray*</code>) then it is delivered on an emulated keypress. This is what any application expects — so pasting anything which contains only such characters is fine.</li>
<li>However, the “other” characters are delivered by <strong>emulating HEX input</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong> : unless your keyboard layout supports input of A LOT of
characters without prefix keys, <em>some buggy applications</em> may skip characters
when you <code>Paste</code> via Console’s UI: <code>Alt-Space E P</code>. ( <strong>This</strong> is why I
recommend using my keyboard layouts!)</p>
<p>One should also keep in mind that the “alternative, ‘more capable’ consoles”
for Windows <strong>are not consoles at all</strong>. They do not support <code>Console-I/O</code>
APIs, so the programs which rely on these APIs to work would not function.
(The programs which use only “File-I/O APIs to the console filehandles” would
work fine, though.)</p>
<p>One example of such non-console is a part of MicroSoft’s <code>Powershell</code>. I do
not use it; to experiment, press and release <code>WinKey</code>, then type <code>powershell</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>(On the other hand, there are programs such as <code>ConEmu</code> or <code>ANSICON</code> which try
to do more: they “attempt” to intercept <code>Console-I/O</code> APIs to make “true
console applications” work too. This definitely works for toy example
programs; in real life, this may or may not solve your particular problems.
Experiment.)</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>set font, keyboard layout (and optionally, allow HEX input).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use only programs which go through <code>Console-I/O</code> APIs, and accept Unicode command-line arguments. For example, any <code>cygwin</code>-compiled program should be fine. As I already said, <code>CMD</code> is fine too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPD:</strong> Initially, for a bug in <code>cp65001</code>, I was mixing up Kernel and CRTL
layers ( <strong>UPD²:</strong> and Windows user-mode API!). <em>Also:</em> Win8 fixes one half of
this bug; I clarified the section about “better console” application, and
added a reference to how Python does it.</p>

    <p>I have a number, for example 1.128347132904321674821 that I would like to show
as only two decimal places when output to screen (or written to a file). How
does one do that?</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1.128347132904321674821</span>
</pre></div>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>The use of:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">options(digits=2)
</pre></div>

<p>Has been suggested as a possible answer. Is there a way to specify this within
a script for one-time use? When I add it to my script it doesn't seem to do
anything different and I'm not interested in a lot of re-typing to format each
number (I'm automating a very large report).</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Answer: round(x, digits=2)</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Some answers suggested on this page (e.g., <code>signif</code>,
<code>options(digits=...)</code>) do not guarantee that a certain number of decimals are
displayed for an arbitrary number. I presume this is a design feature in R
whereby good scientific practice involves showing a certain number of digits
based on principles of "significant figures". However, in many domains (e.g.,
APA style, business reports) formatting requirements dictate that a certain
number of decimal places are displayed. This is often done for consistency and
standardisation purposes rather than being concerned with significant figures.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> :</p>
<p>The following code shows exactly two decimal places for the number <code>x</code>.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">format(round(x, 2), nsmall = 2)
</pre></div>

<p>For example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">format(round(1.20, 2), nsmall = 2)
# [1] "1.20"
format(round(1, 2), nsmall = 2)
# [1] "1.00"
format(round(1.1234, 2), nsmall = 2)
# [1] "1.12"
</pre></div>

<p>A more general function is as follows where <code>x</code> is the number and <code>k</code> is the
number of decimals to show. <code>trimws</code> removes any leading white space which can
be useful if you have a vector of numbers.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">specify_decimal</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">trimws</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">nsmall</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>E.g.,</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">specify_decimal(1234, 5)
# [1] "1234.00000"
specify_decimal(0.1234, 5)
# [1] "0.12340"
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Discussion of alternatives:</strong></p>
<p>The formatC answers and sprintf answers work fairly well. But they will show
negative zeros in some cases which may be unwanted. I.e.,</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">formatC</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">c</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">0</span>.<span class="mi">001</span><span class="ss">)</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">digits</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">format</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"f"</span><span class="ss">)</span>
#<span class="w"> </span>[<span class="mi">1</span>]<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"-0.00"</span>
<span class="k">sprintf</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">0</span>.<span class="mi">001</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">fmt</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'%#.2f'</span><span class="ss">)</span>
#<span class="w"> </span>[<span class="mi">1</span>]<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"-0.00"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>One possible workaround to this is as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">formatC(as.numeric(as.character(round(-.001, 2))), digits = 2, format = "f")
# [1] "0.00"
</pre></div>

<p>iTerm ▶ Preferences ▶ Profiles ▶ Colors ▶ Load Presets ▶ Export</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to get this to work?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>If you have a look at <code>Preferences -&gt; General</code> you will notice at the bottom
of the panel, there is a setting <code>Load preferences from a custom folder or
URL:</code>. There is a button next to it <code>Save settings to Folder</code>.</p>
<p>So all you need to do is save your settings first and load it after you
reinstalled your OS.</p>
<p>If the <code>Save settings to Folder</code> is disabled, select a folder (e.g. empty) in
the <code>Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:</code> text box.</p>
<p>In iTerm2 3.3 on OSX the sequence is: iTerm2 menu, Preferences, General tab,
Preferences subtab</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>It isn't the most obvious workflow. You first have to click "Load preferences
from a custom folder or URL". Select the folder you want them saved in; I keep
an appsync folder in Dropbox for these sorts of things. Once you have selected
the folder, you can click "Save settings to Folder". On a new machine / fresh
install of your OS, you can now load these settings from the folder. At first
I was sure that loading preferences would wipe out my previous settings, but
it didn't.</p>
