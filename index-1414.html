    <p>Way way back (think 20+ years) I encountered a Gomoku game source code in a
magazine that I typed in for my computer and had a lot of fun with.</p>
<p>The game was difficult to win against, but the core algorithm for the computer
AI was really simply and didn't account for a lot of code. I wonder if anyone
knows this algorithm and has some links to some source or theory about it.</p>
<p>The things I remember was that it basically allocated an array that covered
the entire board. Then, whenever I, or it, placed a piece, it would add a
number of weights to all locations on the board that the piece would possibly
impact.</p>
<p>For instance (note that the weights are definitely wrong as I don't remember
those):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="mf">1</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="mf">1</span>
<span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="mf">2</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="mf">444</span>
<span class="mf">1234</span><span class="n">X4321</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span>
<span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="mf">2</span>
<span class="mf">1</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="mf">1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Then it simply scanned the array for an open location with the lowest or
highest value.</p>
<p>Things I'm fuzzy on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it had two arrays, one for me and one for itself and there was a min/max weighting?</li>
<li>There might've been more to the algorithm, but at its core it was basically an array and weighted numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this ring a bell with anyone at all? Anyone got anything that would help?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Reading your description, and thinking a little about it, I think it probably
works with a single array, exactly the way you described.</p>
<p>To accomplish the goal of getting five-in-a-row you have to (a) prevent the
opponent from succeeding and (b) succeed yourself.</p>
<p>To succeed yourself, you have to place stones near other stones you already
have on the board, so it makes sense to add a positive score for fields next
to your stones that could participate in a row. Either the linear example you
gave, or something quadratic would probably work well.</p>
<p>To prevent your opponent from succeeding, you have to place stones next to
<em>his</em> / <em>her</em> stones. It's especially good if you strike two birds with a
single stone, so opponent's stones should increase the value of the
surrounding fields the same way yours do -- the more stones he already has
lined up, the higher the score, and the more likely the algorithm will try to
cut the opponent off.</p>
<p>The most important thing here is the weighting of the different fields, and
whether the opponent's stones are weighted differently than yours.
Unfortunately I can't help with that, but the values should be reasonably
simple to figure out through trial and error once the game itself is written.</p>
<p>However this is a very basic approach, and would be outperformed by a tree
search algorithm. Searching Google, there's a related paper on Threat search,
which apparently works well for Gomoku. The paper is behind a pay-wall though
:/</p>

<p>I haven't read the article, but from the description my guess would be some
form of the Minimax algorithm</p>

    <p>So, for larger networks with large data sets, they take a while to train. It
would be awesome if there was a way to share the computing time across
multiple machines. However, the issue with that is that when a neural network
is training, the weights are constantly being altered every iteration, and
each iteration is more or less based on the last -- which makes the idea of
distributed computing at the very least a challenge.</p>
<p>I've thought that for each portion of the network, the server could send maybe
a 1000 sets of data to train a network on... but... you'd have roughly the
same computing time as I wouldn't be able to train on different sets of data
simultaneously (which is what I want to do).</p>
<p>But even if I could split up the network's training into blocks of different
data sets to train on, how would I know when I'm done with that set of data?
especially if the amount of data sent to the client machine isn't enough to
achieve the desired error?</p>
<p>I welcome all ideas.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Quoting
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation#Multithreaded_Backpropagation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When multicore computers are used multithreaded techniques can greatly
decrease the amount of time that backpropagation takes to converge. If
batching is being used, it is relatively simple to adapt the backpropagation
algorithm to operate in a multithreaded manner.</p>
<p>The training data is broken up into equally large batches for each of the
threads. Each thread executes the forward and backward propagations. The
weight and threshold deltas are summed for each of the threads. At the end
of each iteration all threads must pause briefly for the weight and
threshold deltas to be summed and applied to the neural network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is essentially what other answers here describe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Depending on your ANN model you can exploit some parallelism on multiple
machines by running the same model with the same training and validation data
on multiple machines but set different ANN properies; initial values, ANN
parameters, noise etc, for different runs.</p>
<p>I used to do this a lot to make sure I'd explored the problem space
effectively and wasn't stuck in local minima etc. This is a very easy way to
take advantage of multiple machines without having to recode your algorith.
Just another approach you might want to consider.</p>

    <p>This question came to my mind while working on 2 projects in AI and ML. What
If I'm building a model (e.g. Classification Neural Network,K-NN, .. etc) and
this model uses some function that includes randomness. If I don't fix the
seed, then I'm going to get different accuracy results every time I run the
algorithm on the same training data. However, If I fix it then some other
setting might give better results.</p>
<p>Is averaging a set of accuracies enough to say that the accuracy of this model
is xx % ?</p>
<p>I'm not sure If this is the right place to ask such a question/open such a
discussion.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There are models which are naturally dependent on randomness (e.g., random
forests) and models which only use randomness as part of exploring the space
(e.g., initialisation of values for neural networks), but actually have a
well-defined, deterministic, objective function.</p>
<p>For the first case, you will want to use multiple seeds and report average
accuracy, std. deviation, and the minimum you obtained. It is often good if
you have a way to reproduce this, so just use multiple fixed seeds.</p>
<p>For the second case, you can always tell, just on the training data, which run
is best (although it might actually not be the one which gives you the best
test accuracy!). Thus, if you have the time, it is good to do say, 10 runs,
and then evaluate on the one with the best training error (or validation
error, just <em>never</em> evaluate on <em>testing</em> for this decision). You can go a
level up and do multiple multiple runs and get a standard deviation too.
However, if you find that this is significant, it probably means you weren't
trying enough initialisations or that you are not using the right model for
your data.</p>
