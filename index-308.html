    <p>I have a project in a remote repository, synchronized with a local repository
(development) and the server one (prod). I've been making some commited
changes already pushed to remote and pulled from the server. Now, I want to
undo those changes. So I could just <code>git checkout</code> to the commit before the
changes and commit the new changes, but I'm guessing that there will be
problems to push them again to remote. Any suggestion on how should I proceed?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You can revert individual commits with:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git revert &lt;commit_hash&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>This will create a new commit which reverts the changes of the commit you
specified. Note that it only reverts that specific commit, and not commits
that come after that. If you want to revert a range of commits, you can do it
like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git revert &lt;oldest_commit_hash&gt;..&lt;latest_commit_hash&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>It reverts all the commits after <code>&lt;oldest_commit_hash&gt;</code> up to and including
<code>&lt;latest_commit_hash&gt;</code>. On some versions of git it also reverts the
<code>&lt;oldest_commit_hash&gt;</code>, so double check if that commit gets reverted or not.
You can always drop the latest revert commit (which reverts the oldest commit)
with <code>g reset --hard HEAD~</code>.</p>
<p>To find out the hash of the commit(s) you can use <code>git log</code>.</p>
<p>Look at the git-revert man page for more information about the <code>git revert</code>
command. Also, look at this answer for more information about reverting
commits.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>A solution that keeps no traces of the "undo".</p>
<p>NOTE: don't do this if someone already pulled your change (I would use this
only on my personal repo.)</p>
<p>run:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git reset &lt;previous label or sha1&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>this will re-checkout all the updates locally (so git status will list all
updated files)</p>
<p>then you "do your work" and re-commit your changes (Note: this step is
optional)</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git commit -am "blabla"
</pre></div>

<p>At this moment your local tree differs from the remote</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git push -f &lt;remote-name&gt; &lt;branch-name&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>will force the remote branch to take this push and remove the previous one
(specifying remote-name and branch-name is not mandatory but is recommended to
avoid updating all branches with update flag).</p>

    <p>I've read various articles about mocking vs stubbing in testing, including
Martin Fowler's Mocks Aren't Stubs, but still don't understand the difference.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Stub</strong></p>
<p>I believe the biggest distinction is that a stub you have already written with
predetermined behavior. So you would have a class that implements the
dependency (abstract class or interface most likely) you are faking for
testing purposes and the methods would just be stubbed out with set responses.
They would not do anything fancy and you would have already written the
stubbed code for it outside of your test.</p>
<p><strong>Mock</strong></p>
<p>A mock is something that as part of your test you have to setup with your
expectations. A mock is not setup in a predetermined way so you have code that
does it in your test. Mocks in a way are determined at runtime since the code
that sets the expectations has to run before they do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Difference between Mocks and Stubs</strong></p>
<p>Tests written with mocks usually follow an <code>initialize -&gt; set expectations -&gt;
exercise -&gt; verify</code> pattern to testing. While the pre-written stub would
follow an <code>initialize -&gt; exercise -&gt; verify</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity between Mocks and Stubs</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of both is to eliminate testing all the dependencies of a class or
function so your tests are more focused and simpler in what they are trying to
prove.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>The compiler is warning about this for a reason. It's very rare that this
warning should simply be ignored, and it's easy to work around. Here's how:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">_controller</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_controller</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">selector</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or more tersely (though hard to read &amp; without the guard):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kt">SEL</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">selector</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">NSSelectorFromString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">@"someMethod"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="kt">id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">SEL</span><span class="p">))[</span><span class="n">_controller</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">methodForSelector</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">selector</span><span class="p">])(</span><span class="n">_controller</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">selector</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>What's going on here is you're asking the controller for the C function
pointer for the method corresponding to the controller. All <code>NSObject</code>s
respond to <code>methodForSelector:</code>, but you can also use
<code>class_getMethodImplementation</code> in the Objective-C runtime (useful if you only
have a protocol reference, like <code>id&lt;SomeProto&gt;</code>). These function pointers are
called <code>IMP</code>s, and are simple <code>typedef</code>ed function pointers (<code>id (*IMP)(id,
SEL, ...)</code>)1. This may be close to the actual method signature of the method,
but will not always match exactly.</p>
<p>Once you have the <code>IMP</code>, you need to cast it to a function pointer that
includes all of the details that ARC needs (including the two implicit hidden
arguments <code>self</code> and <code>_cmd</code> of every Objective-C method call). This is handled
in the third line (the <code>(void *)</code> on the right hand side simply tells the
compiler that you know what you're doing and not to generate a warning since
the pointer types don't match).</p>
<p>Finally, you call the function pointer2.</p>
<h3>Complex Example</h3>
<p>When the selector takes arguments or returns a value, you'll have to change
things a bit:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kt">SEL</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">selector</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">NSSelectorFromString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">@"processRegion:ofView:"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">IMP</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">imp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">_controller</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">methodForSelector</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">selector</span><span class="p">];</span>

</pre></div>

<h3>Reasoning for Warning</h3>
<p>The reason for this warning is that with ARC, the runtime needs to know what
to do with the result of the method you're calling. The result could be
anything: <code>void</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>NSString *</code>, <code>id</code>, etc. ARC normally gets
this information from the header of the object type you're working with.3</p>
<p>There are really only 4 things that ARC would consider for the return value:4</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore non-object types (<code>void</code>, <code>int</code>, etc)</li>
<li>Retain object value, then release when it is no longer used (standard assumption)</li>
<li>Release new object values when no longer used (methods in the <code>init</code>/ <code>copy</code> family or attributed with <code>ns_returns_retained</code>)</li>
<li>Do nothing &amp; assume returned object value will be valid in local scope (until inner most release pool is drained, attributed with <code>ns_returns_autoreleased</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The call to <code>methodForSelector:</code> assumes that the return value of the method
it's calling is an object, but does not retain/release it. So you could end up
creating a leak if your object is supposed to be released as in #3 above (that
is, the method you're calling returns a new object).</p>
<p>For selectors you're trying to call that return <code>void</code> or other non-objects,
you could enable compiler features to ignore the warning, but it may be
dangerous. I've seen Clang go through a few iterations of how it handles
return values that aren't assigned to local variables. There's no reason that
with ARC enabled that it can't retain and release the object value that's
returned from <code>methodForSelector:</code> even though you don't want to use it. From
the compiler's perspective, it is an object after all. That means that if the
method you're calling, <code>someMethod</code>, is returning a non object (including
<code>void</code>), you could end up with a garbage pointer value being retained/released
and crash.</p>
<h3>Additional Arguments</h3>
<p>One consideration is that this is the same warning will occur with
<code>performSelector:withObject:</code> and you could run into similar problems with not
declaring how that method consumes parameters. ARC allows for declaring
consumed parameters, and if the method consumes the parameter, you'll probably
eventually send a message to a zombie and crash. There are ways to work around
this with bridged casting, but really it'd be better to simply use the <code>IMP</code>
and function pointer methodology above. Since consumed parameters are rarely
an issue, this isn't likely to come up.</p>
<h3>Static Selectors</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the compiler will not complain about selectors declared
statically:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">_controller</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">performSelector</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="k">@selector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">someMethod</span><span class="p">)];</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The reason for this is because the compiler actually is able to record all of
the information about the selector and the object during compilation. It
doesn't need to make any assumptions about anything. (I checked this a year a
so ago by looking at the source, but don't have a reference right now.)</p>
<h3>Suppression</h3>
<p>In trying to think of a situation where suppression of this warning would be
necessary and good code design, I'm coming up blank. Someone please share if
they have had an experience where silencing this warning was necessary (and
the above doesn't handle things properly).</p>
<h3>More</h3>
<p>It's possible to build up an <code>NSMethodInvocation</code> to handle this as well, but
doing so requires a lot more typing and is also slower, so there's little
reason to do it.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>When the <code>performSelector:</code> family of methods was first added to Objective-C,
ARC did not exist. While creating ARC, Apple decided that a warning should be
generated for these methods as a way of guiding developers toward using other
means to explicitly define how memory should be handled when sending arbitrary
messages via a named selector. In Objective-C, developers are able to do this
by using C style casts on raw function pointers.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Swift, Apple has documented the <code>performSelector:</code>
family of methods as "inherently unsafe" and they are not available to Swift.</p>
<p>Over time, we have seen this progression:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early versions of Objective-C allow <code>performSelector:</code> (manual memory management)</li>
<li>Objective-C with ARC warns for use of <code>performSelector:</code>
</li>
<li>Swift does not have access to <code>performSelector:</code> and documents these methods as "inherently unsafe"</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea of sending messages based on a named selector is not, however, an
"inherently unsafe" feature. This idea has been used successfully for a long
time in Objective-C as well as many other programming languages.</p>
<hr>
<p>1 All Objective-C methods have two hidden arguments, <code>self</code> and <code>_cmd</code> that
are implicitly added when you call a method.</p>
<p>2 Calling a <code>NULL</code> function is not safe in C. The guard used to check for the
presence of the controller ensures that we have an object. We therefore know
we'll get an <code>IMP</code> from <code>methodForSelector:</code> (though it may be
<code>_objc_msgForward</code>, entry into the message forwarding system). Basically, with
the guard in place, we know we have a function to call.</p>
<p>3 Actually, it's possible for it to get the wrong info if declare you objects
as <code>id</code> and you're not importing all headers. You could end up with crashes in
code that the compiler thinks is fine. This is very rare, but could happen.
Usually you'll just get a warning that it doesn't know which of two method
signatures to choose from.</p>
<p>4 See the ARC reference on retained return values and unretained return values
for more details.</p>

<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">#</span><span class="nn">pragma</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">clang</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">diagnostic</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">push</span>
<span class="p">#</span><span class="nn">pragma</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">clang</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">diagnostic</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">ignored</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"-Warc-performSelector-leaks"</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="cp">[</span><span class="bp">self.</span><span class="nx nx-Member">ticketTarget</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">performSelector</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="bp">self.</span><span class="nx nx-Member">ticketAction</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">withObject</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="cp">]</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="p">#</span><span class="nn">pragma</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">clang</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">diagnostic</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">pop</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you're getting the error in several places, and want to use the C macro
system to hide the pragmas, you can define a macro to make it easier to
suppress the warning:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">#<span class="nv">define</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">SuppressPerformSelectorLeakWarning</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">Stuff</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>\
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span>\
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">_Pragma</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s2">"clang diagnostic push"</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>\
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">_Pragma</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s2">"clang diagnostic ignored \"</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">Warc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">performSelector</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">leaks</span>\<span class="s2">""</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>\
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">Stuff</span><span class="c1">; \</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">_Pragma</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s2">"clang diagnostic pop"</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>\
<span class="w">    </span>}<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="ss">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can use the macro like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">SuppressPerformSelectorLeakWarning</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">_target</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">performSelector</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">_action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">withObject</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you need the result of the performed message, you can do this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kt">id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">SuppressPerformSelectorLeakWarning</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">result</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">_target</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">performSelector</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">_action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">withObject</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
