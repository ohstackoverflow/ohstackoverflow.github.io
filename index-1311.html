    <p>Is there any query/way to show the last queries executed on <strong>ALL</strong> servers?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>For those blessed with MySQL &gt;= 5.1.12, you can control this option globally
at runtime:</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute <code>SET GLOBAL log_output = 'TABLE';</code>
</li>
<li>Execute <code>SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';</code>
</li>
<li>Take a look at the table <code>mysql.general_log</code>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you prefer to output to a file instead of a table:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>SET GLOBAL log_output = "FILE";</code> <em>the default</em>.</li>
<li><code>SET GLOBAL general_log_file = "/path/to/your/logfile.log";</code></li>
<li><code>SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer this method to editing .cnf files because:</p>
<ol>
<li>you're not editing the <code>my.cnf</code> file and potentially permanently turning on logging</li>
<li>you're not fishing around the filesystem looking for the query log - or even worse, distracted by the need for the perfect destination. <code>/var/log /var/data/log</code> <code>/opt /home/mysql_savior/var</code>
</li>
<li>You don't have to restart the server and interrupt any current connections to it.</li>
<li>restarting the server leaves you where you started (log is by default still off)</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see MySQL 5.1 Reference Manual - Server System Variables
- general_log</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You can enable a general query log for that sort of diagnostic. Generally you
don't log all SELECT queries on a production server though, it's a performance
killer.</p>
<p>Edit your MySQL config, e.g. /etc/mysql/my.cnf - look for, or add, a line like
this</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">[mysqld]</span>
<span class="na">log</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">/var/log/mysql/mysql.log</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Restart mysql to pick up that change, now you can</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">tail</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">log</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">mysql</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">mysql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Hey presto, you can watch the queries as they come in.</p>

    <p>I'm calling functions from a 32-bit unmanaged DLL on a 64-bit system. What I
get is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BadImageFormatException: An attempt was made to load a program with an
incorrect format. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007000B)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I had my projects set to the Any CPU platform, so I changed them
both to x86, but this error is still occurring. That's really the only fix I
know for this.</p>
<p>The DLLs aren't corrupt or anything, because I can use them with other
programs (that I don't have the source to). I thought that perhaps it wasn't
finding a dependency, but I checked and they're all there. Plus, wouldn't it
throw a <code>DllNotFoundException</code> in that case?</p>
<p>What else can I do? And before you say "Use a 64-bit unmanaged DLL instead,"
let me point out that there isn't one. ;)</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Somehow, the <strong>Build</strong> checkbox in the Configuration Manager had been
unchecked for my executable, so it was still running with the old Any CPU
build. After I fixed that, Visual Studio complained that it couldn't debug the
assembly, but that was fixed with a restart.</p>

    <p>If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how is that secure? Couldn't I
just grab the token out of the header, decode and change the user information
in the payload, and send it back with the same correct encoded secret?</p>
<p>I know they must be secure, but I just would really like to understand the
technologies. What am I missing?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>JWTs can be either signed, encrypted or both. If a token is signed, but not
encrypted, everyone can read its contents, but when you don't know the private
key, you can't change it. Otherwise, the receiver will notice that the
signature won't match anymore.</p>
<p>Answer to your comment: I'm not sure if I understand your comment the right
way. Just to be sure: do you know and understand digital signatures? I'll just
briefly explain one variant (HMAC, which is symmetrical, but there are many
others).</p>
<p>Let's assume Alice wants to send a JWT to Bob. They both know some shared
secret. Mallory doesn't know that secret, but wants to interfere and change
the JWT. To prevent that, Alice calculates <code>Hash(payload + secret)</code> and
appends this as signature.</p>
<p>When receiving the message, Bob can also calculate <code>Hash(payload + secret)</code> to
check whether the signature matches. If however, Mallory changes something in
the content, she isn't able to calculate the matching signature (which would
be <code>Hash(newContent + secret)</code>). She doesn't know the secret and has no way of
finding it out. This means if she changes something, the signature won't match
anymore, and Bob will simply not accept the JWT anymore.</p>
<p>Let's suppose, I send another person the message <code>{"id":1}</code> and sign it with
<code>Hash(content + secret)</code>. (+ is just concatenation here). I use the SHA256
Hash function, and the signature I get is:
<code>330e7b0775561c6e95797d4dd306a150046e239986f0a1373230fda0235bda8c</code>. Now it's
your turn: play the role of Mallory and try to sign the message <code>{"id":2}</code>.
You can't because you don't know which secret I used. If I suppose that the
recipient knows the secret, he CAN calculate the signature of any message and
check if it's correct.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You can go to <code>jwt.io</code>, paste your token and read the contents. This is
jarring for a lot of people initially.</p>
<p>The short answer is that JWT doesn't concern itself with encryption. It cares
about validation. That is to say, it can always get the answer for "Have the
contents of this token been manipulated"? This means user manipulation of the
JWT token is futile because the server will know and disregard the token. The
server adds a signature based on the payload when issuing a token to the
client. Later on it verifies the payload and matching signature.</p>
<p>The logical question is what is the motivation for not concerning itself with
encrypted contents?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The simplest reason is because it assumes this is a solved problem for the most part. If dealing with a client like the web browser for example, you can store the JWT tokens in a cookie that is <code>secure</code> (is not transmitted via HTTP, only via HTTPS) and <code>httpOnly</code> (can't be read by Javascript) and talks to the server over an encrypted channel (HTTPS). Once you know you have a secure channel between the server and client you can securely exchange JWT or whatever else you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This keeps thing simple. A simple implementation makes adoption easier but it also lets each layer do what it does best (let HTTPS handle encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JWT isn't meant to store sensitive data. Once the server receives the JWT token and validates it, it is free to lookup the user ID in its own database for additional information for that user (like permissions, postal address, etc). This keeps JWT small in size and avoids inadvertent information leakage because everyone knows not to keep sensitive data in JWT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not too different from how cookies themselves work. Cookies often contain
unencrypted payloads. If you are using HTTPS then everything is good. If you
aren't then it's advisable to encrypt sensitive cookies themselves. Not doing
so will mean that a man-in-the-middle attack is possible--a proxy server or
ISP reads the cookies and then replays them later on pretending to be you. For
similar reasons, JWT should always be exchanged over a secure layer like
HTTPS.</p>
