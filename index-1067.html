    <p>For a new node.js project I'm working on, I'm thinking about switching over
from a cookie based session approach (by this, I mean, storing an id to a key-
value store containing user sessions in a user's browser) to a token-based
session approach (no key-value store) using JSON Web Tokens (jwt).</p>
<p>The project is a game that utilizes socket.io - having a token-based session
would be useful in such a scenario where there will be multiple communication
channels in a single session (web and socket.io)</p>
<p>How would one provide token/session invalidation from the server using the jwt
Approach?</p>
<p>I also wanted to understand what common (or uncommon) pitfalls/attacks I
should look out for with this sort of paradigm. For example, if this paradigm
is vulnerable to the same/different kinds of attacks as the session
store/cookie-based approach.</p>

<p>A logout (or invalidate) for the Session Store approach would require an
update to the KeyValueStore database with the specified token.</p>
<p>It seems like such a mechanism would not exist in the token-based approach
since the token itself would contain the info that would normally exist in the
key-value store.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I too have been researching this question, and while none of the ideas below
are complete solutions, they might help others rule out ideas, or provide
further ones.</p>
<p><em>1) Simply remove the token from the client</em></p>
<p>Obviously this does nothing for server side security, but it does stop an
attacker by removing the token from existence (ie. they would have to have
stolen the token prior to logout).</p>
<p><em>2) Create a token blocklist</em></p>
<p>You could store the invalid tokens until their initial expiry date, and
compare them against incoming requests. This seems to negate the reason for
going fully token based in the first place though, as you would need to touch
the database for every request. The storage size would likely be lower though,
as you would only need to store tokens that were between logout &amp; expiry time
(this is a gut feeling, and is definitely dependent on context).</p>
<p><em>3) Just keep token expiry times short and rotate them often</em></p>
<p>If you keep the token expiry times at short enough intervals, and have the
running client keep track and request updates when necessary, number 1 would
effectively work as a complete logout system. The problem with this method, is
that it makes it impossible to keep the user logged in between closes of the
client code (depending on how long you make the expiry interval).</p>
<p><em>Contingency Plans</em></p>
<p>If there ever was an emergency, or a user token was compromised, one thing you
could do is allow the user to change an underlying user lookup ID with their
login credentials. This would render all associated tokens invalid, as the
associated user would no longer be able to be found.</p>
<p>I also wanted to note that it is a good idea to include the last login date
with the token, so that you are able to enforce a relogin after some distant
period of time.</p>
<p>In terms of similarities/differences with regards to attacks using tokens,
this post addresses the question:
https://github.com/dentarg/blog/blob/master/_posts/2014-01-07-angularjs-
authentication-with-cookies-vs-token.markdown</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The ideas posted above are good, but a very simple and easy way to invalidate
all the existing JWTs is simply to change the secret.</p>
<p>If your server creates the JWT, signs it with a secret (JWS) then sends it to
the client, simply changing the secret will invalidating all existing tokens
and require all users to gain a new token to authenticate as their old token
suddenly becomes invalid according to the server.</p>
<p>It doesn't require any modifications to the actual token contents (or lookup
ID).</p>
<p>Clearly this only works for an emergency case when you wanted all existing
tokens to expire, for per token expiry one of the solutions above is required
(such as short token expiry time or invalidating a stored key inside the
token).</p>

    <p>Compiling a C++ file takes a very long time when compared to C# and Java. It
takes significantly longer to compile a C++ file than it would to run a normal
size Python script. I'm currently using VC++ but it's the same with any
compiler. Why is this?</p>
<p>The two reasons I could think of were loading header files and running the
preprocessor, but that doesn't seem like it should explain why it takes so
long.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Several reasons</p>
<h2>Header files</h2>
<p>Every single compilation unit requires hundreds or even thousands of headers
to be (1) loaded and (2) compiled. Every one of them typically has to be
recompiled for every compilation unit, because the preprocessor ensures that
the result of compiling a header <em>might</em> vary between every compilation unit.
(A macro may be defined in one compilation unit which changes the content of
the header).</p>
<p>This is probably <em>the</em> main reason, as it requires huge amounts of code to be
compiled for every compilation unit, and additionally, every header has to be
compiled multiple times (once for every compilation unit that includes it).</p>
<h2>Linking</h2>
<p>Once compiled, all the object files have to be linked together. This is
basically a monolithic process that can't very well be parallelized, and has
to process your entire project.</p>
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>The syntax is extremely complicated to parse, depends heavily on context, and
is very hard to disambiguate. This takes a lot of time.</p>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>In C#, <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is the only type that is compiled, no matter how many
instantiations of List you have in your program. In C++, <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> is a
completely separate type from <code>vector&lt;float&gt;</code>, and each one will have to be
compiled separately.</p>
<p>Add to this that templates make up a full Turing-complete "sub-language" that
the compiler has to interpret, and this can become ridiculously complicated.
Even relatively simple template metaprogramming code can define recursive
templates that create dozens and dozens of template instantiations. Templates
may also result in extremely complex types, with ridiculously long names,
adding a lot of extra work to the linker. (It has to compare a lot of symbol
names, and if these names can grow into many thousand characters, that can
become fairly expensive).</p>
<p>And of course, they exacerbate the problems with header files, because
templates generally have to be defined in headers, which means far more code
has to be parsed and compiled for every compilation unit. In plain C code, a
header typically only contains forward declarations, but very little actual
code. In C++, it is not uncommon for almost all the code to reside in header
files.</p>
<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p>C++ allows for some very dramatic optimizations. C# or Java don't allow
classes to be completely eliminated (they have to be there for reflection
purposes), but even a simple C++ template metaprogram can easily generate
dozens or hundreds of classes, all of which are inlined and eliminated again
in the optimization phase.</p>
<p>Moreover, a C++ program must be fully optimized by the compiler. A C# program
can rely on the JIT compiler to perform additional optimizations at load-time,
C++ doesn't get any such "second chances". What the compiler generates is as
optimized as it's going to get.</p>
<h2>Machine</h2>
<p>C++ is compiled to machine code which may be somewhat more complicated than
the bytecode Java or .NET use (especially in the case of x86). (This is
mentioned out of completeness only because it was mentioned in comments and
such. In practice, this step is unlikely to take more than a tiny fraction of
the total compilation time).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most of these factors are shared by C code, which actually compiles fairly
efficiently. The parsing step is a lot more complicated in C++, and can take
up significantly more time, but the main offender is probably templates.
They're useful, and make C++ a far more powerful language, but they also take
their toll in terms of compilation speed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Parsing and code generation are actually rather fast. The real problem is
opening and closing files. Remember, even with include guards, the compiler
still have open the .H file, and read each line (and then ignore it).</p>
<p>A friend once (while bored at work), took his company's application and put
everything -- all source and header files-- into one big file. Compile time
dropped from 3 hours to 7 minutes.</p>
