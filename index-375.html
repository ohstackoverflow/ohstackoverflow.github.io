    <p>First of all, some definitions:</p>
<p>PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing
resource, the enclosed entity <strong>SHOULD be considered as a modified version
of the one residing on the origin server</strong>. If the Request-URI does not
point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a
new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the
resource with that URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PATCH method requests that <strong>a set of changes</strong> described in the request
entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request- URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.</p>
<p>Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to <code>/users</code> with the
data <code>{username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code> and the server
is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource
location (lets assume <code>/users/1</code>) and any next call to GET <code>/users/1</code> will
return <code>{id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code>.</p>
<p>Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered "a
set of changes" and therefore I should PATCH <code>/users/1</code> with "patch document".
In my case it would be the JSON document: <code>{email:
'skwee357@newdomain.example'}</code>. The server then returns 200 (assuming
permission are ok). This brings me to first question:</p>
<ul>
<li>PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?</li>
</ul>
<p>PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to
solve the problem of "patching" or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was
introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was
introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings
me to my second (and the main) question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to <strong>replace</strong> entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. <code>/users</code> to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : When I first spent time reading about REST, idempotence was a
confusing concept to try to get right. I still didn't get it quite right in my
original answer, as further comments (and Jason Hoetger's answer) have shown.
For a while, I have resisted updating this answer extensively, to avoid
effectively plagiarizing Jason, but I'm editing it now because, well, I was
asked to (in the comments).</p>
<p>After reading my answer, I suggest you also read Jason Hoetger's excellent
answer to this question, and I will try to make my answer better without
simply stealing from Jason.</p>
<h3>Why is PUT idempotent?</h3>
<p>As you noted in your RFC 2616 citation, PUT is considered idempotent. When you
PUT a resource, these two assumptions are in play:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are referring to an entity, not to a collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entity you are supplying is complete (the <em>entire</em> entity).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at one of your examples.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"username"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"email"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357@domain.example"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you POST this document to <code>/users</code>, as you suggest, then you might get back
an entity such as</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">##</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">users</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"username"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"email"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357@domain.example"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you want to modify this entity later, you choose between PUT and PATCH. A
PUT might look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PUT /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can accomplish the same using PATCH. That might look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You'll notice a difference right away between these two. The PUT included all
of the parameters on this user, but PATCH only included the one that was being
modified (<code>email</code>).</p>
<p>When using PUT, it is assumed that you are sending the complete entity, and
that complete entity <em>replaces</em> any existing entity at that URI. In the above
example, the PUT and PATCH accomplish the same goal: they both change this
user's email address. But PUT handles it by replacing the entire entity, while
PATCH only updates the fields that were supplied, leaving the others alone.</p>
<p>Since PUT requests include the entire entity, if you issue the same request
repeatedly, it should always have the same outcome (the data you sent is now
the entire data of the entity). Therefore PUT is idempotent.</p>
<h3>Using PUT wrong</h3>
<p>What happens if you use the above PATCH data in a PUT request?</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@domain.example"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">PUT /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"      // new email address... and nothing else!</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>(I'm assuming for the purposes of this question that the server doesn't have
any specific required fields, and would allow this to happen... that may not
be the case in reality.)</p>
<p>Since we used PUT, but only supplied <code>email</code>, now that's the only thing in
this entity. This has resulted in data loss.</p>
<p>This example is here for illustrative purposes -- don't ever actually do this
(unless your intent is to drop the omitted fields, of course... then you are
using PUT as it should be used). This PUT request is technically idempotent,
but that doesn't mean it isn't a terrible, broken idea.</p>
<h3>How can PATCH be idempotent?</h3>
<p>In the above example, PATCH <em>was</em> idempotent. You made a change, but if you
made the same change again and again, it would always give back the same
result: you changed the email address to the new value.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@domain.example"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // email address was changed</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address... again</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // nothing changed since last GET</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>My original example, fixed for accuracy</h3>
<p>I originally had examples that I thought were showing non-idempotency, but
they were misleading / incorrect. I am going to keep the examples, but use
them to illustrate a different thing: that multiple PATCH documents against
the same entity, modifying different attributes, do not make the PATCHes non-
idempotent.</p>
<p>Let's say that at some past time, a user was added. This is the state that you
are starting from.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"id"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"name"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"Sam Kwee"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"email"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357@olddomain.example"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"address"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"123 Mockingbird Lane"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"city"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"New York"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"state"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"NY"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"zip"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"10001"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>After a PATCH, you have a modified entity:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{"email": "skwee357@newdomain.example"}</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">  "id": 1,</span>
<span class="err">  "name": "Sam Kwee",</span>
<span class="err">  "email": "skwee357@newdomain.example",    // the email changed, yay!</span>
<span class="err">  "address": "123 Mockingbird Lane",</span>
<span class="err">  "city": "New York",</span>
<span class="err">  "state": "NY",</span>
<span class="err">  "zip": "10001"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you then repeatedly apply your PATCH, you will continue to get the same
result: the email was changed to the new value. A goes in, A comes out,
therefore this is idempotent.</p>
<p>An hour later, after you have gone to make some coffee and take a break,
someone else comes along with their own PATCH. It seems the Post Office has
been making some changes.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{"zip": "12345"}</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">  "id": 1,</span>
<span class="err">  "name": "Sam Kwee",</span>
<span class="err">  "email": "skwee357@newdomain.example",  // still the new email you set</span>
<span class="err">  "address": "123 Mockingbird Lane",</span>
<span class="err">  "city": "New York",</span>
<span class="err">  "state": "NY",</span>
<span class="err">  "zip": "12345"                      // and this change as well</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Since this PATCH from the post office doesn't concern itself with email, only
zip code, if it is repeatedly applied, it will also get the same result: the
zip code is set to the new value. A goes in, A comes out, therefore this is
<em>also</em> idempotent.</p>
<p>The next day, you decide to send your PATCH again.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{"email": "skwee357@newdomain.example"}</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">  "id": 1,</span>
<span class="err">  "name": "Sam Kwee",</span>
<span class="err">  "email": "skwee357@newdomain.example",</span>
<span class="err">  "address": "123 Mockingbird Lane",</span>
<span class="err">  "city": "New York",</span>
<span class="err">  "state": "NY",</span>
<span class="err">  "zip": "12345"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Your patch has the same effect it had yesterday: it set the email address. A
went in, A came out, therefore this is idempotent as well.</p>
<h3>What I got wrong in my original answer</h3>
<p>I want to draw an important distinction (something I got wrong in my original
answer). Many servers will respond to your REST requests by sending back the
new entity state, with your modifications (if any). So, when you get this
<em>response</em> back, it is different <em>from the one you got back yesterday</em> ,
because the zip code is not the one you received last time. However, your
request was not concerned with the zip code, only with the email. So your
PATCH document is still idempotent - the email you sent in PATCH is now the
email address on the entity.</p>
<h3>So when is PATCH not idempotent, then?</h3>
<p>For a full treatment of this question, I again refer you to Jason Hoetger's
answer which already fully answers that.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Though Dan Lowe's excellent answer very thoroughly answered the OP's question
about the difference between PUT and PATCH, its answer to the question of why
PATCH is not idempotent is not quite correct.</p>
<p>To show why PATCH isn't idempotent, it helps to start with the definition of
idempotence (from Wikipedia):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term idempotent is used more comprehensively to describe an operation
that will produce the same results if executed once or multiple times [...]
An idempotent function is one that has the property f(f(x)) = f(x) for any
value x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In more accessible language, an idempotent PATCH could be defined as: After
PATCHing a resource with a patch document, all subsequent PATCH calls to the
same resource with the same patch document will not change the resource.</p>
<p>Conversely, a non-idempotent operation is one where f(f(x)) != f(x), which for
PATCH could be stated as: After PATCHing a resource with a patch document,
subsequent PATCH calls to the same resource with the same patch document
<strong>do</strong> change the resource.</p>
<p>To illustrate a non-idempotent PATCH, suppose there is a /users resource, and
suppose that calling <code>GET /users</code> returns a list of users, currently:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">{ "id": 1, "username": "firstuser", "email": "firstuser@example.org" }</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Rather than PATCHing /users/{id}, as in the OP's example, suppose the server
allows PATCHing /users. Let's issue this PATCH request:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users</span>
<span class="err">[{ "op": "add", "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" }]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Our patch document instructs the server to add a new user called <code>newuser</code> to
the list of users. After calling this the first time, <code>GET /users</code> would
return:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">{ "id": 1, "username": "firstuser", "email": "firstuser@example.org" },</span>
<span class="n"> { "id": 2, "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" }</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, if we issue the <em>exact same</em> PATCH request as above, what happens? (For
the sake of this example, let's assume that the /users resource allows
duplicate usernames.) The "op" is "add", so a new user is added to the list,
and a subsequent <code>GET /users</code> returns:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">{ "id": 1, "username": "firstuser", "email": "firstuser@example.org" },</span>
<span class="n"> { "id": 2, "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" },</span>
<span class="n"> { "id": 3, "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" }</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The /users resource has changed <em>again</em> , even though we issued the <em>exact
same</em> PATCH against the <em>exact same</em> endpoint. If our PATCH is f(x), f(f(x))
is not the same as f(x), and therefore, <strong>this particular PATCH is not
idempotent</strong>.</p>
<p>Although PATCH isn't <em>guaranteed</em> to be idempotent, there's nothing in the
PATCH specification to prevent you from making all PATCH operations on your
particular server idempotent. RFC 5789 even anticipates advantages from
idempotent PATCH requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also
helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the
same resource in a similar time frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Dan's example, his PATCH operation is, in fact, idempotent. In that
example, the /users/1 entity changed between our PATCH requests, but not
<em>because of</em> our PATCH requests; it was actually the Post Office's <em>different</em>
patch document that caused the zip code to change. The Post Office's different
PATCH is a different operation; if our PATCH is f(x), the Post Office's PATCH
is g(x). Idempotence states that <code>f(f(f(x))) = f(x)</code>, but makes no guarantes
about <code>f(g(f(x)))</code>.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How can it be? Isn't the memory of a local variable inaccessible outside its
function?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You rent a hotel room. You put a book in the top drawer of the bedside table
and go to sleep. You check out the next morning, but "forget" to give back
your key. You steal the key!</p>
<p>A week later, you return to the hotel, do not check in, sneak into your old
room with your stolen key, and look in the drawer. Your book is still there.
Astonishing!</p>
<p><strong>How can that be? Aren't the contents of a hotel room drawer inaccessible if
you haven't rented the room?</strong></p>
<p>Well, obviously that scenario can happen in the real world no problem. There
is no mysterious force that causes your book to disappear when you are no
longer authorized to be in the room. Nor is there a mysterious force that
prevents you from entering a room with a stolen key.</p>
<p>The hotel management is not <em>required</em> to remove your book. You didn't make a
contract with them that said that if you leave stuff behind, they'll shred it
for you. If you illegally re-enter your room with a stolen key to get it back,
the hotel security staff is not <em>required</em> to catch you sneaking in. You
didn't make a contract with them that said "if I try to sneak back into my
room later, you are required to stop me." Rather, you signed a contract with
them that said "I promise not to sneak back into my room later", a contract
which <em>you broke</em>.</p>
<p>In this situation <strong>anything can happen</strong>. The book can be there—you got
lucky. Someone else's book can be there and yours could be in the hotel's
furnace. Someone could be there right when you come in, tearing your book to
pieces. The hotel could have removed the table and book entirely and replaced
it with a wardrobe. The entire hotel could be just about to be torn down and
replaced with a football stadium, and you are going to die in an explosion
while you are sneaking around.</p>
<p>You don't know what is going to happen; when you checked out of the hotel and
stole a key to illegally use later, you gave up the right to live in a
predictable, safe world because <em>you</em> chose to break the rules of the system.</p>
<p><strong>C++ is not a safe language</strong>. It will cheerfully allow you to break the
rules of the system. If you try to do something illegal and foolish like going
back into a room you're not authorized to be in and rummaging through a desk
that might not even be there anymore, C++ is not going to stop you. Safer
languages than C++ solve this problem by restricting your power—by having much
stricter control over keys, for example.</p>
<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>Holy goodness, this answer is getting a lot of attention. (I'm not sure why—I
considered it to be just a "fun" little analogy, but whatever.)</p>
<p>I thought it might be germane to update this a bit with a few more technical
thoughts.</p>
<p>Compilers are in the business of generating code which manages the storage of
the data manipulated by that program. There are lots of different ways of
generating code to manage memory, but over time two basic techniques have
become entrenched.</p>
<p>The first is to have some sort of "long lived" storage area where the
"lifetime" of each byte in the storage—that is, the period of time when it is
validly associated with some program variable—cannot be easily predicted ahead
of time. The compiler generates calls into a "heap manager" that knows how to
dynamically allocate storage when it is needed and reclaim it when it is no
longer needed.</p>
<p>The second method is to have a “short-lived” storage area where the lifetime
of each byte is well known. Here, the lifetimes follow a “nesting” pattern.
The longest-lived of these short-lived variables will be allocated before any
other short-lived variables, and will be freed last. Shorter-lived variables
will be allocated after the longest-lived ones, and will be freed before them.
The lifetime of these shorter-lived variables is “nested” within the lifetime
of longer-lived ones.</p>
<p>Local variables follow the latter pattern; when a method is entered, its local
variables come alive. When that method calls another method, the new method's
local variables come alive. They'll be dead before the first method's local
variables are dead. The relative order of the beginnings and endings of
lifetimes of storages associated with local variables can be worked out ahead
of time.</p>
<p>For this reason, local variables are usually generated as storage on a "stack"
data structure, because a stack has the property that the first thing pushed
on it is going to be the last thing popped off.</p>
<p>It's like the hotel decides to only rent out rooms sequentially, and you can't
check out until everyone with a room number higher than you has checked out.</p>
<p>So let's think about the stack. In many operating systems you get one stack
per thread and the stack is allocated to be a certain fixed size. When you
call a method, stuff is pushed onto the stack. If you then pass a pointer to
the stack back out of your method, as the original poster does here, that's
just a pointer to the middle of some entirely valid million-byte memory block.
In our analogy, you check out of the hotel; when you do, you just checked out
of the highest-numbered occupied room. If no one else checks in after you, and
you go back to your room illegally, all your stuff is guaranteed to still be
there <em>in this particular hotel</em>.</p>
<p>We use stacks for temporary stores because they are really cheap and easy. An
implementation of C++ is not required to use a stack for storage of locals; it
could use the heap. It doesn't, because that would make the program slower.</p>
<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to leave the garbage you left on the
stack untouched so that you can come back for it later illegally; it is
perfectly legal for the compiler to generate code that turns back to zero
everything in the "room" that you just vacated. It doesn't because again, that
would be expensive.</p>
<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to ensure that when the stack
logically shrinks, the addresses that used to be valid are still mapped into
memory. The implementation is allowed to tell the operating system "we're done
using this page of stack now. Until I say otherwise, issue an exception that
destroys the process if anyone touches the previously-valid stack page".
Again, implementations do not actually do that because it is slow and
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead, implementations let you make mistakes and get away with it. Most of
the time. Until one day something truly awful goes wrong and the process
explodes.</p>
<p>This is problematic. There are a lot of rules and it is very easy to break
them accidentally. I certainly have many times. And worse, the problem often
only surfaces when memory is detected to be corrupt billions of nanoseconds
after the corruption happened, when it is very hard to figure out who messed
it up.</p>
<p>More memory-safe languages solve this problem by restricting your power. In
"normal" C# there simply is no way to take the address of a local and return
it or store it for later. You can take the address of a local, but the
language is cleverly designed so that it is impossible to use it after the
lifetime of the local ends. In order to take the address of a local and pass
it back, you have to put the compiler in a special "unsafe" mode, <em>and</em> put
the word "unsafe" in your program, to call attention to the fact that you are
probably doing something dangerous that could be breaking the rules.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You're are simply reading and writing to memory that <em>used to</em> be the address
of <code>a</code>. Now that you're outside of <code>foo</code>, it's just a pointer to some random
memory area. It just so happens that in your example, that memory area does
exist and nothing else is using it at the moment.</p>
<p>You don't break anything by continuing to use it, and nothing else has
overwritten it yet. Therefore, the <code>5</code> is still there. In a real program, that
memory would be reused almost immediately and you'd break something by doing
this (though the symptoms may not appear until much later!).</p>
<p>When you return from <code>foo</code>, you tell the OS that you're no longer using that
memory and it can be reassigned to something else. If you're lucky and it
never does get reassigned, and the OS doesn't catch you using it again, then
you'll get away with the lie. Chances are though you'll end up writing over
whatever else ends up with that address.</p>
<p>Now if you're wondering why the compiler doesn't complain, it's probably
because <code>foo</code> got eliminated by optimization. It usually will warn you about
this sort of thing. C assumes you know what you're doing though, and
technically you haven't violated scope here (there's no reference to <code>a</code>
itself outside of <code>foo</code>), only memory access rules, which only triggers a
warning rather than an error.</p>
<p>In short: this won't usually work, but sometimes will by chance.</p>
