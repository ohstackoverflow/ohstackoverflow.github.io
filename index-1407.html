    <p>I have built my first neural network in python, and i've been playing around
with a few datasets; it's going well so far !</p>
<p>I have a quick question regarding modelling events with multiple outcomes: -</p>
<p>Say i wish to train a network to tell me the probability of each runner
winning a 100m sprint. I would give the network all of the relevant data
regarding each runner, and the number of outputs would be equal to the number
of runners in the race.</p>
<p>My question is, using a sigmoid function, how can i ensure the sum of the
outputs will be equal to 1.0 ? Will the network naturally learn to do this, or
will i have to somehow make this happen explicitly ? If so, how would i go
about doing this ?</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The output from your neural network will <em>approach</em> 1. I don't think it will
actually get to 1.</p>
<p>You actually don't need to see which output is equal to 1. Once you've trained
your network up to a specific error level, when you present the inputs, just
look for the maximum output in your output later. For example, let's say your
output layer presents the following output: <code>[0.0001, 0.00023, 0.0041,
0.99999412, 0.0012, 0.0002]</code>, then the runner that won the race is runner
number 4.</p>
<p>So yes, your network will "learn" to produce 1, but it won't exactly be 1.
This is why you train to within a certain error rate. I recently created a
neural network to recognize handwritten digits, and this is the method that I
used. In my output layer, I have a vector with 10 components. The first
component represents 0, and the last component represents 9. So when I present
a 4 to the network, I expect the output vector to look like <code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. Of course, it's not what I get exactly, but it's what I train
the network to provide. So to find which digit it is, I simply check to see
which component has the highest output or score.</p>
<p>Now in your second question, I believe you're asking <em>how</em> the network would
learn to provide the correct answer? To do this, you need to provide your
network with some training data and train it until the output is under a
certain error threshold. So what you need is a set of data that contains the
inputs <em>and</em> the correct output. Initially your neural network will be set up
with random weights (there are some algorithms that help you select <em>better</em>
weights to minimize training time, but that's a little more advanced). Next
you need a way to tell the neural network to <em>learn</em> from the data provided.
So basically you give the data to the neural network and it provides an
output, which is highly likely to be wrong. Then you compare that data with
the expected (correct) output and you tell the neural network to update its
weights so that it gets closer to the correct answer. You do this over and
over again until the error is below a certain threshold.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to implement the stochastic backpropagation
algorithm. In this algorithm, you calculate the error between the actual
output of the neural network and the expected output. Then you backpropagate
the error from the output layer all the way up to the weights to the hidden
layer, adjusting the weights as you go. Then you repeat this process until the
error that you calculate is below a certain threshold. So during each step,
you're getting closer and closer towards your solution.</p>
<p>You can use the algorithm described here. There is a decent amount of math
involved, so be prepared for that! If you want to see an example of an
implementation of this algorithm, you can take a look at this Java code that I
have on github. The code uses momentum and a simple form of simulated
annealing as well, but the standard backpropagation algorithm should be easily
discernible. The Wikipedia article on backpropagation has a link to an
implementation of the backpropagation algorithm in Python.</p>
<p>You're probably not going to understand the algorithm immediately; expect to
spend some time understanding it and working through some of the math. I sat
down with a pencil and paper as I was coding, and that's how I eventually
understood what was going on.</p>
<p>Here are a few resources that should help you understand backpropagation a
little better:</p>
<ul>
<li>The learning process: backpropagation</li>
<li>Error backpropagation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want some more resources, you can also take a look at my answer here.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Basically you want a function of multiple real numbers that converts those
real numbers into probabilities (each between 0 to 1, sum to 1). You can this
easily by post processing the output of your network.</p>
<p>Your network gives you real numbers r1, r2, ..., rn that increases as the
probability of each runner wins the race.</p>
<p>Then compute exp(r1), exp(r2), ..., and sum them up for ers = exp(r1) +
exp(r2) + ... + exp(rn). Then the probability that the first racer wins is
exp(r1) / ers.</p>
<p>This is a one use of the Boltzman distribution.

    <p>I have this question in my mind for long but never got reasonable answer for
that :</p>
<p>Usually in artifitial intelligent course when it comes to search it is always
said that BFS is optimal but DFS is not but I can come up with many example
that shows with DFS we can even get the answer faster. So can anyone explain
it ? Am I missing something?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Optimal as in "produces the optimal path", not "is the fastest algorithm
possible". When searching a state space for a path to a goal, DFS may produce
a much longer path than BFS. Note that BFS is only optimal when actions are
unweighted; if different actions have different weights, you need something
like A*.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>This is because by <em>optimal strategy</em> they mean the one whose returned
solution maximizes the utility.</p>
<p>Regarding this, nothing <em>guarantees</em> that the first solution found by DFS s
optimal. Also BFS is not optimal in a general sense, so your statement as-is
is wrong.</p>
<p>The main point here is about being <em>guaranteed</em> that a certain search strategy
will <em>always</em> return the optimal result. Any strategy might be the best in a
given case, but often (especially in AI), you don't know in what specific case
you are, at most you have some hypothesis on that case.</p>
<p>However, <strong>DFS is optimal</strong> when the search tree is finite, all action costs
are identical and all solutions have the same length. However limitating this
may sound, there is an important class of problems that satisfies these
conditions: the CSPs ( <em>constraint satisfaction problems</em> ). Maybe all the
examples you thought about fall in this (rather common) category.</p>

    <p>I have spent a whole day trying to implement minimax without really
understanding it. Now, , I think I understand how minimax works, but not
alpha-beta pruning.</p>
<p>This is my understanding of minimax:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a list of all possible moves, up until the depth limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate how favorable a game field is for every node on the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every node, (starting from the bottom), the score of that node is the highest score of it's children if the layer is max. If the layer is min, the score of that node is the lowest score of it's children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the move that has the highest score if you are trying to max it, or the lowest if you want the min score.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My understanding of alpha-beta pruning is that, if the parent layer is min and
your node has a higher score than the minimum score, then you can prune it
since it will not affect the result.</p>
<p>However, what I don't understand is, if you can work out the score of a node,
you will need to know the score of all nodes on a layer lower than the node
(in my understanding of minimax). Which means that you'llstill be using the
same amount of CPU power.</p>
<p>Could anyone please point out what I am getting wrong? This answer ( Minimax
explained for an idiot ) helped me understand minimax, but I don't get how
alpha beta pruning would help.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>To understand Alpha-Beta, consider the following situation. It's Whites turn,
white is trying to maximize the score, black is trying to minimize the score.</p>
<p>White evaluates move A,B, and C and finds the best score is 20 with C. Now
consider what happens when evaluating move D:</p>
<p>If white selects move D, we need to consider counter-moves by black. Early on,
we find black can capture the white queen, and that subtree gets a MIN score
of 5 due to the lost queen. However, we have not considered all of blacks
counter-moves. Is it worth checking the rest? No.</p>
<p>We don't care if black can get a score lower than 5 because whites move "C"
could keep the score to 20. Black will not choose a counter-move with a score
higher than 5 because he is trying to MINimize the score and has already found
move with a score of 5. For white, move C is preferred over move D as soon as
the MIN for D (5 so far) goes below that of C (20 for sure). So we "prune" the
rest of the tree there, pop back up a level and evaluate white moves
E,F,G,H.... to the end.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You don't need to evaluate the entire subtree of a node to decide its value.
Alpha Beta Pruning uses two dynamically computed bounds alpha and beta to
bound the values that nodes can take.</p>
<p>Alpha is the minimum value that the max player is guaranteed (regardless of
what the min player does) through another path through the game tree. This
value is used to perform cutoffs (pruning) at the minimizing levels. When the
min player has discovered that the score of a min node would necessarily be
less than alpha, it need not evaluate any more choices from that node because
the max player already has a better move (the one which has value alpha).</p>
<p>Beta is the maximum value that the min player is guaranteed and is used to
perform cutoffs at the maximizing levels. When the max player has discovered
that the score of a max node would necessarily be greater than beta, it can
stop evaluating any more choices from that node because the min player would
not allow it to take this path since the min player already has a path that
guarantees a value of beta.</p>
<p>I've written a detailed explanation of Alpha Beta Pruning, its pseudocode and
several improvements:
