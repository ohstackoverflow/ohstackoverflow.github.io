✨  Done in 27.28s.

A template was not provided. This is likely because you're using an outdated version of create-react-app.
Please note that global installs of create-react-app are no longer supported.
</pre></div>

<p>In package.json of <code>my-app</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">"dependencies": {
  "react": "^16.12.0",
  "react-dom": "^16.12.0",
  "react-scripts": "3.3.0" &lt;-- up-to-date
}
</pre></div>

<p>I checked out the CRA changelog and it looks like support was added for custom
templates - however it doesn't look like the command <code>create-react-app my-app</code>
would have changed.</p>
<p>Any idea what is going on here?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you've previously installed <code>create-react-app</code> globally via <code>npm install
-g create-react-app</code>, we recommend you uninstall the package using <code>npm
uninstall -g create-react-app</code> to ensure that <code>npx</code> always uses the latest
version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Docs</p>
<p>Use either one of the below commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npx create-react-app my-app</code></li>
<li><code>npm init react-app my-app</code></li>
<li><code>yarn create react-app my-app</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>if<code>npm uninstall -g create-react-app</code> stated above does not work.</strong> Type
<code>which create-react-app</code> to know where it is installed. Mine was installed in
<code>/usr/bin</code> folder. Then do <code>sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/create-react-app</code>. (Credit to
@v42 comment below)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>1)</strong></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">npm uninstall -g create-react-app
</pre></div>

<p>or</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">yarn global remove create-react-app
</pre></div>

<p><strong>2)</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be a bug where create-react-app isn't properly uninstalled and
using one of the new commands lead to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A template was not provided. This is likely because you're using an outdated
version of create-react-app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After uninstalling it with <code>npm uninstall -g create-react-app</code>, check whether
you still have it "installed" with <code>which create-react-app</code> (Windows: <code>where
create-react-app</code>) on your command line. If it returns something (e.g.
<em>/usr/local/bin/create-react-app</em> ), then do a <code>rm -rf /usr/local/bin/create-
react-app</code> to delete manually.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong></p>
<p>Then one of these ways:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">npx create-react-app my-app
npm init react-app my-app
yarn create react-app my-app

<p>Note from the docs though: For InnoDB tables, <strong>the row count is only a rough

counts (which is more expensive).</p>

<p>You can probably put something together with Tables table. I've never done it,
but it looks like it has a column for <em>TABLE_ROWS</em> and one for <em>TABLE NAME</em>.</p>
<p>To get rows per table, you can use a query like this:</p>

    <p>I thought that they were basically the same thing — writing programs that
split tasks between processors (on machines that have 2+ processors). Then I'm
reading this, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Async methods are intended to be non-blocking operations. An await
expression in an async method doesn’t block the current thread while the
awaited task is running. Instead, the expression signs up the rest of the
method as a continuation and returns control to the caller of the async
method.</p>
<p>The async and await keywords don't cause additional threads to be created.
Async methods don't require multithreading because an async method doesn't
run on its own thread. The method runs on the current synchronization
context and uses time on the thread only when the method is active. You can
use Task.Run to move CPU-bound work to a background thread, but a background
thread doesn't help with a process that's just waiting for results to become
available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I'm wondering whether someone can translate that to English for me. It
seems to draw a distinction between asynchronicity (is that a word?) and
threading and imply that you can have a program that has asynchronous tasks
but no multithreading.</p>
<p>Now I understand the idea of asynchronous tasks such as the example on pg. 467
of Jon Skeet's <em>C# In Depth, Third Edition</em></p>

</pre></div>

<p>The <code>async</code> keyword means " <em>This function, whenever it is called, will not be
called in a context in which its completion is required for everything after
its call to be called."</em></p>
<p>In other words, writing it in the middle of some task</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">int x = 5; 
DisplayWebsiteLength();
double y = Math.Pow((double)x,2000.0);
</pre></div>

<p>, since <code>DisplayWebsiteLength()</code> has nothing to do with <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>, will cause
<code>DisplayWebsiteLength()</code> to be executed "in the background", like</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c">                processor 1                |      processor 2</span>
<span class="nb">-------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c">int x = 5;                                 |  DisplayWebsiteLength()</span>
<span class="c">double y = Math</span><span class="nt">.</span><span class="c">Pow((double)x</span><span class="nt">,</span><span class="c">2000</span><span class="nt">.</span><span class="c">0);     |</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Obviously that's a stupid example, but am I correct or am I totally confused
or what?</p>
<p>(Also, I'm confused about why <code>sender</code> and <code>e</code> aren't ever used in the body of
the above function.)</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Your misunderstanding is extremely common. Many people are taught that
multithreading and asynchrony are the same thing, but they are not.</p>
<p>An analogy usually helps. You are cooking in a restaurant. An order comes in
for eggs and toast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronous: you cook the eggs, then you cook the toast.</li>
<li>Asynchronous, single threaded: you start the eggs cooking and set a timer. You start the toast cooking, and set a timer. While they are both cooking, you clean the kitchen. When the timers go off you take the eggs off the heat and the toast out of the toaster and serve them.</li>
<li>Asynchronous, multithreaded: you hire two more cooks, one to cook eggs and one to cook toast. Now you have the problem of coordinating the cooks so that they do not conflict with each other in the kitchen when sharing resources. And you have to pay them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now does it make sense that multithreading is only one kind of asynchrony?
<strong>Threading is about workers; asynchrony is about tasks</strong>. In multithreaded
workflows you assign tasks to workers. In asynchronous single-threaded
workflows you have a graph of tasks where some tasks depend on the results of
others; as each task completes it invokes the code that schedules the next
task that can run, given the results of the just-completed task. But you
(hopefully) only need one worker to perform all the tasks, not one worker per
task.</p>
<p>It will help to realize that many tasks are not processor-bound. For
processor-bound tasks it makes sense to hire as many workers (threads) as
there are processors, assign one task to each worker, assign one processor to
each worker, and have each processor do the job of nothing else but computing
the result as quickly as possible. But for tasks that are not waiting on a
processor, you don't need to assign a worker at all. You just wait for the
message to arrive that the result is available and <em>do something else while
you're waiting</em>. When that message arrives then you can schedule the
continuation of the completed task as the next thing on your to-do list to
check off.</p>
<p>So let's look at Jon's example in more detail. What happens?</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone invokes DisplayWebSiteLength. Who? We don't care.</li>
<li>It sets a label, creates a client, and asks the client to fetch something. The client returns an object representing the task of fetching something. That task is in progress.</li>
<li>Is it in progress on another thread? Probably not. Read Stephen's article on why there is no thread.</li>
<li>Now we await the task. What happens? We check to see if the task has completed between the time we created it and we awaited it. If yes, then we fetch the result and keep running. Let's suppose it has not completed. <strong>We sign up the remainder of this method as the continuation of that task and return</strong>.</li>
<li>Now control has returned to the caller. What does it do? Whatever it wants.</li>
<li>Now suppose the task completes. How did it do that? Maybe it was running on another thread, or maybe the caller that we just returned to allowed it to run to completion on the current thread. Regardless, we now have a completed task.</li>
<li>The completed task asks the correct thread -- again, likely the <em>only</em> thread -- to run the continuation of the task. </li>
<li>Control passes immediately back into the method we just left at the point of the await. Now there <em>is</em> a result available so we can assign <code>text</code> and run the rest of the method.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's just like in my analogy. Someone asks you for a document. You send away
in the mail for the document, and keep on doing other work. When it arrives in
the mail you are signalled, and when you feel like it, you do the rest of the
workflow -- open the envelope, pay the delivery fees, whatever. You don't need
to hire another worker to do all that for you.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>In-browser Javascript is a great example of an asynchronous program that has
no multithreading.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry about multiple pieces of code touching the same
objects at the same time: each function will finish running before any other
javascript is allowed to run on the page. ( <em>Update: Since this was written,
JavaScript has added async functions and generator functions. These functions
do not always run to completion before any other javascript is executed:
whenever they reach a<code>yield</code> or <code>await</code> keyword, they yield execution to other
javascript, and can continue execution later, similar to C#'s <code>async</code>
methods.</em>)</p>
<p>However, when doing something like an AJAX request, no code is running at all,
so other javascript can respond to things like click events until that request
comes back and invokes the callback associated with it. If one of these other
event handlers is still running when the AJAX request gets back, its handler
won't be called until they're done. There's only one JavaScript "thread"
running, even though it's possible for you to effectively pause the thing you
were doing until you have the information you need.</p>
<p>In C# applications, the same thing happens any time you're dealing with UI
elements--you're only allowed to interact with UI elements when you're on the
UI thread. If the user clicked a button, and you wanted to respond by reading
a large file from the disk, an inexperienced programmer might make the mistake
of reading the file within the click event handler itself, which would cause
the application to "freeze" until the file finished loading because it's not
allowed to respond to any more clicking, hovering, or any other UI-related
events until that thread is freed.</p>
<p>One option programmers might use to avoid this problem is to create a new
thread to load the file, and then tell that thread's code that when the file
is loaded it needs to run the remaining code on the UI thread again so it can
update UI elements based on what it found in the file. Until recently, this
approach was very popular because it was what the C# libraries and language
made easy, but it's fundamentally more complicated than it has to be.</p>
<p>If you think about what the CPU is doing when it reads a file at the level of
the hardware and Operating System, it's basically issuing an instruction to
read pieces of data from the disk into memory, and to hit the operating system
with an "interrupt" when the read is complete. In other words, reading from
disk (or any I/O really) is an inherently <em>asynchronous</em> operation. The
concept of a thread waiting for that I/O to complete is an abstraction that
the library developers created to make it easier to program against. It's not
necessary.</p>
<p>Now, most I/O operations in .NET have a corresponding <code>...Async()</code> method you
can invoke, which returns a <code>Task</code> almost immediately. You can add callbacks
to this <code>Task</code> to specify code that you want to have run when the asynchronous
operation completes. You can also specify which thread you want that code to
run on, and you can provide a token which the asynchronous operation can check
from time to time to see if you decided to cancel the asynchronous task,
giving it the opportunity to stop its work quickly and gracefully.</p>
<p>Until the <code>async/await</code> keywords were added, C# was much more obvious about
how callback code gets invoked, because those callbacks were in the form of
delegates that you associated with the task. In order to still give you the
benefit of using the <code>...Async()</code> operation, while avoiding complexity in
code, <code>async/await</code> abstracts away the creation of those delegates. But
they're still there in the compiled code.</p>
<p>So you can have your UI event handler <code>await</code> an I/O operation, freeing up the
UI thread to do other things, and more-or-less automatically returning to the
UI thread once you've finished reading the file--without ever having to create
a new thread.</p>
