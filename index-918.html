    <p>I have a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element and I want to put a border on it. I know I can write

    <p>Coming from mercurial, I use branches to organize features. Naturally, I want
to see this work-flow in my history as well.</p>
<p>I started my new project using git and finished my first feature. When merging
the feature, I realized git uses fast-forward, i.e. it applies my changes
directly to the master branch if possible and forgets about my branch.</p>
<p>So to think into the future: I'm the only one working on this project. If I
use git's default approach (fast-forward merging), my history would result in
one giant master branch. Nobody knows I used a separate branch for every
feature, because in the end I'll have only that giant master branch. Won't
that look unprofessional?</p>
<p>By this reasoning, I don't want fast-forward merging and can't see why it is
the default. What's so good about it?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Fast-forward merging makes sense for short-lived branches, but in a more
complex history, non-fast-forward merging may make the history easier to
understand, and make it easier to revert a group of commits.</p>
<p><em><strong>Warning</strong> : Non-fast-forwarding has potential side effects as well. Please
review https://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html, avoid the 'no-ff' with
its "checkpoint commits" that break bisect or blame, and carefully consider
whether it should be your default approach for <code>master</code>.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>--no-ff</code> flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object,
even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing
information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups
together all commits that together added the feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jakub Narębski also mentions the config <strong><code>merge.ff</code></strong> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a commit
that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of the current
branch is fast-forwarded.<br>
 When set to <code>false</code>, this variable tells Git to create an extra merge
commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <code>--no-ff</code> option from the
command line).<br>
 When set to '<code>only</code>', only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent
to giving the <code>--ff-only</code> option from the command line).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The fast-forward is the default because:</p>
<ul>
<li>short-lived branches are very easy to create and use in Git</li>
<li>short-lived branches often isolate many commits that can be reorganized freely within that branch</li>
<li>those commits are actually part of the main branch: once reorganized, the main branch is fast-forwarded to include them.</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you anticipate an iterative workflow on one topic/feature branch (i.e.,
I merge, then I go back to this feature branch and add some more commits),
then it is useful to include only the merge in the main branch, rather than
all the intermediate commits of the feature branch.</p>
<p>In this case, you can end up setting this kind of config file:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">[branch "master"]</span>
<span class="c1"># This is the list of cmdline options that should be added to git-merge </span>
<span class="c1"># when I merge commits into the master branch.</span>

<span class="c1"># The option --no-commit instructs git not to commit the merge</span>
<span class="c1"># by default. This allows me to do some final adjustment to the commit log</span>
<span class="c1"># message before it gets commited. I often use this to add extra info to</span>
<span class="c1"># the merge message or rewrite my local branch names in the commit message</span>
<span class="c1"># to branch names that are more understandable to the casual reader of the git log.</span>

<span class="c1"># Option --no-ff instructs git to always record a merge commit, even if</span>
<span class="c1"># the branch being merged into can be fast-forwarded. This is often the</span>
<span class="c1"># case when you create a short-lived topic branch which tracks master, do</span>
<span class="c1"># some changes on the topic branch and then merge the changes into the</span>
<span class="c1"># master which remained unchanged while you were doing your work on the</span>
<span class="c1"># topic branch. In this case the master branch can be fast-forwarded (that</span>
<span class="c1"># is the tip of the master branch can be updated to point to the tip of</span>
<span class="c1"># the topic branch) and this is what git does by default. With --no-ff</span>
<span class="c1"># option set, git creates a real merge commit which records the fact that</span>
<span class="c1"># another branch was merged. I find this easier to understand and read in</span>
<span class="c1"># the log.</span>

<hr>
<p>The OP adds in the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see some sense in fast-forward for [short-lived] branches, but making it
the default action means that git assumes you... often have [short-lived]
branches. Reasonable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jefromi answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the lifetime of branches varies greatly from user to user. Among
experienced users, though, there's probably a tendency to have far more
short-lived branches.</p>
<p>To me, <strong>a short-lived branch is one that I create in order to make a
certain operation easier</strong> (rebasing, likely, or quick patching and
testing), and then immediately delete once I'm done.<br>
 That means it likely <strong>should be absorbed into the topic branch it forked
from</strong> , and the topic branch will be merged as one branch. No one needs to
know what I did internally in order to create the series of commits
implementing that given feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More generally, I add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it really depends on your development workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it is linear, one branch makes sense.</li>
<li>If you need to isolate features and work on them for a long period of
time and repeatedly merge them, several branches make sense.
</li>
</ul>
<p>See " <strong>When should you branch?</strong> "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, when you consider the Mercurial branch model, it is at its core
<em>one</em> branch per repository (even though you can create anonymous heads,
bookmarks and even named branches)<br>
See "Git and Mercurial - Compare and Contrast".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mercurial, by default, uses anonymous lightweight codelines, which in its
terminology are called "heads".<br>
 Git uses lightweight named branches, with injective mapping to map names of
branches in remote repository to names of remote-tracking branches.<br>
 Git "forces" you to name branches (well, with the exception of a single
unnamed branch, which is a situation called a "detached HEAD"), but I think
this works better with branch-heavy workflows such as topic branch workflow,
meaning multiple branches in a single repository paradigm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Let me expand a bit on a VonC's very comprehensive answer:</p>
<hr>
<p>First, if I remember it correctly, the fact that Git by default doesn't create
<em>merge commits</em> in the <em>fast-forward</em> case has come from considering single-
branch "equal repositories", where <strong>mutual pull is used to sync</strong> those two
repositories (a workflow you can find as first example in most user's
documentation, including "The Git User's Manual" and "Version Control by
Example"). In this case you don't use pull to merge fully realized branch, you
use it to keep up with other work. You don't want to have ephemeral and
unimportant fact when you happen to do a sync saved and stored in repository,
saved for the future.</p>
<p>Note that usefulness of feature branches and of having multiple branches in
single repository came only later, with more widespread usage of VCS with good
merging support, and with trying various merge-based workflows. That is why
for example Mercurial originally supported only one branch per repository
(plus anonymous tips for tracking remote branches), as seen in older revisions
of "Mercurial: The Definitive Guide".</p>
<hr>
<p>Second, when following <strong>best practices</strong> of using <strong>feature branches</strong> ,
namely that feature branches should all start from stable version (usually
from last release), to be able to cherry-pick and select which features to
include by selecting which feature branches to merge, <strong>you are usually not in
fast-forward situation</strong>... which makes this issue moot. You need to worry
about creating a true merge and not fast-forward when merging a very first
branch (assuming that you don't put single-commit changes directly on
'master'); all other later merges are of course in non fast-forward situation.</p>
