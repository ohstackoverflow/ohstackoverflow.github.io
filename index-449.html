    <p>It's common in C++ to name member variables with some kind of prefix to denote
the fact that they're member variables, rather than local variables or
parameters. If you've come from an MFC background, you'll probably use
<code>m_foo</code>. I've also seen <code>myFoo</code> occasionally.</p>
<p>C# (or possibly just .NET) seems to recommend using just an underscore, as in
<code>_foo</code>. Is this allowed by the C++ standard?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The rules (which did not change in C++11):</p>
<ul>
<li>Reserved in any scope, including for use as implementation macros: <ul>
<li>identifiers beginning with an underscore followed immediately by an uppercase letter</li>
<li>identifiers containing adjacent underscores (or "double underscore")</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reserved in the global namespace: <ul>
<li>identifiers beginning with an underscore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, everything in the <code>std</code> namespace is reserved. (You are allowed to add template specializations, though.) </li>
</ul>
<p>From the 2003 C++ Standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>17.4.3.1.2 Global names [lib.global.names]</h4>
<p>Certain sets of names and function signatures are always reserved to the
implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each name that contains a double underscore (<code>__</code>) or begins with an
underscore followed by an uppercase letter (2.11) is reserved to the
implementation for any use.</li>
<li>Each name that begins with an underscore is reserved to the
implementation for use as a name in the global namespace.165
</li>
</ul>
<p>165) Such names are also reserved in namespace <code>::std</code> (17.4.3.1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because C++ is based on the C standard (1.1/2, C++03) and C99 is a normative
reference (1.2/1, C++03) these also apply, from the 1999 C Standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>7.1.3 Reserved identifiers</h4>
<p>Each header declares or defines all identifiers listed in its associated
subclause, and optionally declares or defines identifiers listed in its
associated future library directions subclause and identifiers which are
always reserved either for any use or for use as file scope identifiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>All identifiers that begin with an underscore and either an uppercase
letter or another underscore are always reserved for any use.</li>
<li>All identifiers that begin with an underscore are always reserved for
use as identifiers with file scope in both the ordinary and tag name spaces.</li>
<li>Each macro name in any of the following subclauses (including the future
library directions) is reserved for use as specified if any of its
associated headers is included; unless explicitly stated otherwise (see
7.1.4).</li>
<li>All identifiers with external linkage in any of the following subclauses
(including the future library directions) are always reserved for use as
identifiers with external linkage.154</li>
<li>Each identifier with file scope listed in any of the following
subclauses (including the future library directions) is reserved for use as
a macro name and as an identifier with file scope in the same name space if
any of its associated headers is included.
</li>
</ul>
<p>No other identifiers are reserved. If the program declares or defines an
identifier in a context in which it is reserved (other than as allowed by
7.1.4), or defines a reserved identifier as a macro name, the behavior is
undefined.</p>
<p>If the program removes (with <code>#undef</code>) any macro definition of an identifier
in the first group listed above, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>154) The list of reserved identifiers with external linkage includes
<code>errno</code>, <code>math_errhandling</code>, <code>setjmp</code>, and <code>va_end</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other restrictions might apply. For example, the POSIX standard reserves a lot
of identifiers that are likely to show up in normal code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names beginning with a capital <code>E</code> followed a digit or uppercase letter: <ul>
<li>may be used for additional error code names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with either <code>is</code> or <code>to</code> followed by a lowercase letter <ul>
<li>may be used for additional character testing and conversion functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with <code>LC_</code> followed by an uppercase letter <ul>
<li>may be used for additional macros specifying locale attributes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names of all existing mathematics functions suffixed with <code>f</code> or <code>l</code> are reserved <ul>
<li>for corresponding functions that operate on float and long double arguments, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with <code>SIG</code> followed by an uppercase letter are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional signal names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that begin with <code>SIG_</code> followed by an uppercase letter are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional signal actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names beginning with <code>str</code>, <code>mem</code>, or <code>wcs</code> followed by a lowercase letter are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional string and array functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names beginning with <code>PRI</code> or <code>SCN</code> followed by any lowercase letter or <code>X</code> are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional format specifier macros</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Names that end with <code>_t</code> are reserved <ul>
<li>for additional type names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While using these names for your own purposes right now might not cause a
problem, they do raise the possibility of conflict with future versions of
that standard.</p>
<hr>
<p>Personally I just don't start identifiers with underscores. New addition to my
rule: Don't use double underscores anywhere, which is easy as I rarely use
underscore.</p>
<p>After doing research on this article I no longer end my identifiers with <code>_t</code>
as this is reserved by the POSIX standard.</p>
<p>The rule about any identifier ending with <code>_t</code> surprised me a lot. I think
that is a POSIX standard (not sure yet) looking for clarification and official
chapter and verse. This is from the GNU libtool manual, listing reserved
names.</p>
<p>CesarB provided the following link to the POSIX 2004 reserved symbols and
notes 'that many other reserved prefixes and suffixes ... can be found there'.
The POSIX 2008 reserved symbols are defined here. The restrictions are
somewhat more nuanced than those above.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The rules to avoid collision of names are both in the C++ standard (see
Stroustrup book) and mentioned by C++ gurus (Sutter, etc.).</p>
<h3>Personal rule</h3>
<p>Because I did not want to deal with cases, and wanted a simple rule, I have
designed a <strong>personal</strong> one that is both simple and correct:</p>
<p><strong>When naming a symbol, you will avoid collision with compiler/OS/standard
libraries if you:</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>**</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>never start a symbol with an underscore
**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>never name a symbol with two consecutive underscores inside.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, putting your code in an unique namespace helps to avoid collision,
too (but won't protect against evil macros)</p>
<h3>Some examples</h3>
<p>(I use macros because they are the more code-polluting of C/C++ symbols, but
it could be anything from variable name to class name)</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">#define _WRONG
#define __WRONG_AGAIN
#define RIGHT_
#define WRONG__WRONG
#define RIGHT_RIGHT
#define RIGHT_x_RIGHT
</pre></div>

<h3>Extracts from C++0x draft</h3>
<p>From the n3242.pdf file (I expect the final standard text to be similar):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>17.6.3.3.2 Global names [global.names]</strong></p>
<p>Certain sets of names and function signatures are always reserved to the
implementation:</p>
<p>— Each name that contains a double underscore _ _ or begins with an
underscore followed by an uppercase letter (2.12) is reserved to the
implementation for any use.</p>
<p>— Each name that begins with an underscore is reserved to the implementation
for use as a name in the global namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>17.6.3.3.5 User-defined literal suffixes [usrlit.suffix]</strong></p>
<p>Literal suffix identifiers that do not start with an underscore are reserved
for future standardization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last clause is confusing, unless you consider that a name starting with
one underscore and followed by a lowercase letter would be Ok if <em>not</em> defined
in the global namespace...</p>

    <p>I know <code>pip</code> is a package manager for python packages. However, I saw the
installation on IPython's website use <code>conda</code> to install IPython.</p>
<p>Can I use <code>pip</code> to install IPython? Why should I use <code>conda</code> as another python
package manager when I already have <code>pip</code>?</p>
<p>What is the difference between <code>pip</code> and <code>conda</code>?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Quoting from the Conda blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having been involved in the python world for so long, we are all aware of
pip, easy_install, and virtualenv, but these tools did not meet all of our
specific requirements. The main problem is that they are focused around
Python, neglecting non-Python library dependencies, such as HDF5, MKL, LLVM,
etc., which do not have a setup.py in their source code and also do not
install files into Python’s site-packages directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Conda is a packaging tool and installer that aims to do more than what
<code>pip</code> does; handle library dependencies <em>outside</em> of the Python packages as
well as the Python packages themselves. Conda also creates a virtual
environment, like <code>virtualenv</code> does.</p>
<p>As such, Conda should be compared to Buildout perhaps, another tool that lets
you handle both Python and non-Python installation tasks.</p>
<p>Because Conda introduces a new packaging format, you cannot use <code>pip</code> and
Conda interchangeably; <code>pip</code> cannot install the Conda package format. You can
use the two tools side by side (by installing <code>pip</code> with <code>conda install pip</code>)
but they do not interoperate either.</p>
<p>Since writing this answer, Anaconda has published a new page on <em>Understanding
Conda and Pip</em> , which echoes this as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This highlights a key difference between conda and pip. Pip installs Python
packages whereas conda installs packages which may contain software written
in any language. For example, before using pip, a Python interpreter must be
installed via a system package manager or by downloading and running an
installer. Conda on the other hand can install Python packages as well as
the Python interpreter directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and further on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally a package is needed which is not available as a conda package
but is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip. In these cases, it
makes sense to try to use both conda and pip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> : This answer describes the state of things as it was a decade
ago, at that time pip did not support binary packages. Conda was specifically
created to better support building and distributing binary packages, in
particular data science libraries with C extensions. For reference, pip only
gained widespread support for portable binary packages with wheels (pip 1.4 in
2013) and the manylinux1 specification (pip 8.1 in March 2016). See the more
recent answer for more history.</p>
<p>Here is a short rundown:</p>
<h3>pip</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python packages only.</li>
<li>Compiles everything from source. <strong>EDIT: pip now installs binary wheels, if they are available.</strong>
</li>
<li>Blessed by the core Python community (i.e., Python 3.4+ includes code that automatically bootstraps pip).</li>
</ul>
<h3>conda</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python agnostic. The main focus of existing packages are for Python, and indeed Conda itself is written in Python, but you can also have Conda packages for C libraries, or R packages, or really anything.</li>
<li>Installs binaries. There is a tool called <code>conda build</code> that builds packages from source, but <code>conda install</code> itself installs things from already built Conda packages.</li>
<li>External. conda is an environment and package manager. It is included in the Anaconda Python distribution provided by Continuum Analytics (now called Anaconda, Inc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>conda is an environment manager written in Python and is language-agnostic.
conda environment management functions cover the functionality provided by
venv, virtualenv, pipenv, pyenv, and other Python-specific package managers.
You could use conda within an existing Python installation by pip installing
it (though this is not recommended unless you have a good reason to use an
existing installation). As of 2022, conda and pip are not fully aware of one
another package management activities within a virtual environment, not are
they interoperable for Python package management.</p>
<p>In both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written in Python</li>
<li>Open source (conda is BSD and pip is MIT)</li>
<li>Warning: While conda itself is open-source, the package repositories are hosted by Anaconda Inc and have restrictions around commercial usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two bullet points of conda are really what make it advantageous over
pip for many packages. Since pip installs from source, it can be painful to
install things with it if you are unable to compile the source code (this is
especially true on Windows, but it can even be true on Linux if the packages
have some difficult C or FORTRAN library dependencies). conda installs from
binary, meaning that someone (e.g., Continuum) has already done the hard work
of compiling the package, and so the installation is easy.</p>
<p>There are also some differences if you are interested in building your own
packages. For instance, pip is built on top of setuptools, whereas conda uses
its own format, which has some advantages (like being static, and again,
Python agnostic).</p>

<p>and tried again and I get the same message. I'm assuming that <code>w3tc</code> changed
something in the config file on the server. I don't care whether the local
copy or remote copy goes on the server (I suppose the remote one is best), I
just want to be able to merge the rest of my changes (plugin updates).</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You can't merge with local modifications. Git protects you from losing
potentially important changes.</p>
<p>You have three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Commit the change using</h3>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git commit -m "My message"
</pre></div>

</li>
<li>
<h3>Stash it.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stashing acts as a stack, where you can push changes, and you pop them in
reverse order.</p>
<p>To stash, type</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">    git stash
</pre></div>

<p>Do the merge, and then pull the stash:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">    git stash pop
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>Discard the local changes</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>using <code>git reset --hard</code><br>
or <code>git checkout -t -f remote/branch</code></p>
<h3>Or: Discard local changes for a specific file</h3>
<p>using <code>git checkout filename</code></p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git stash
git pull &lt;remote name&gt; &lt;remote branch name&gt; (or) switch branch
git stash apply --index
</pre></div>

<p>The first command stores your changes temporarily in the stash and removes
them from the working directory.</p>
<p>The second command switches branches.</p>
<p>The third command restores the changes which you have stored in the stash (the
<code>--index</code> option is useful to make sure that staged files are still staged).</p>
