    <p>Can you please tell me the difference between Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and back-propagation?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Backpropagation is an efficient method of <strong>computing gradients</strong> in directed
graphs of computations, such as neural networks. This is <strong>not</strong> a learning
method, but rather a nice computational trick which is <strong>often used in
learning methods</strong>. This is actually a simple implementation of <strong>chain rule</strong>
of derivatives, which simply gives you the ability to compute all required
partial derivatives in linear time in terms of the graph size (while naive
gradient computations would scale exponentially with depth).</p>
<p>SGD is one of many optimization methods, namely <strong>first order optimizer</strong> ,
meaning, that it is based on analysis of the <strong>gradient</strong> of the objective.
Consequently, in terms of neural networks it is often applied together with
backprop to make efficient updates. You could also apply SGD to gradients
obtained in a different way (from sampling, numerical approximators etc.).
Symmetrically you can use other optimization techniques with backprop as well,
everything that can use gradient/jacobian.</p>
<p>This common misconception comes from the fact, that for simplicity people
sometimes say "trained with backprop", what actually means (if they do not
specify optimizer) "trained with SGD using backprop as a gradient computing
technique". Also, in old textbooks you can find things like "delta rule" and
other a bit confusing terms, which describe exactly the same thing (as neural
network community was for a long time a bit independent from general
optimization community).</p>
<p>Thus you have two layers of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>gradient computation - where backprop comes to play</li>
<li>optimization level - where techniques like SGD, Adam, Rprop, BFGS etc. come into play, which (if they are first order or higher) use gradient computed above</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Stochastic gradient descent</strong> (SGD) is an optimization method used e.g. to
minimize a loss function.</p>
<p>In the SGD, you use <em>1 example</em> , at each iteration, to update the weights of
your model, depending on the error due to this example, instead of using the
average of the errors of <em>all</em> examples (as in "simple" <em>gradient descent</em> ),
at each iteration. To do so, SGD needs to compute the "gradient of your
model".</p>
<p><strong>Backpropagation</strong> is an efficient technique to compute this "gradient" that
SGD uses.</p>

    <p>while I'm reading in how to build ANN in pybrain, they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Train the network for some epochs. Usually you would set something like 5
here,</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">trainer.trainEpochs( 1 )
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>I looked for what is that mean , then I conclude that we use an epoch of data
to update weights, If I choose to train the data with 5 epochs as pybrain
advice, the dataset will be divided into 5 subsets, and the wights will update
5 times as maximum.</p>
<p>I'm familiar with online training where the wights are updated after each
sample data or feature vector, My question is how to be sure that 5 epochs
will be enough to build a model and setting the weights probably? what is the
advantage of this way on online training? Also the term "epoch" is used on
online training, does it mean one feature vector?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>One epoch consists of <em>one</em> full training cycle on the training set. Once
every sample in the set is seen, you start again - marking the beginning of
the 2nd epoch.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with batch or online training per se. Batch means that
you update <em>once</em> at the end of the epoch (after <strong>every</strong> sample is seen,
i.e. #epoch updates) and online that you update after <strong>each</strong> <em>sample</em>
(#samples * #epoch updates).</p>
<p>You can't be sure if 5 epochs or 500 is enough for convergence since it will
vary from data to data. You can stop training when the error converges or gets
lower than a certain threshold. This also goes into the territory of
preventing overfitting. You can read up on early stopping and cross-validation
regarding that.</p>

    <p>All the examples I have seen of neural networks are for a fixed set of inputs
which works well for images and fixed length data. How do you deal with
variable length data such sentences, queries or source code? Is there a way to
encode variable length data into fixed length inputs and still get the
generalization properties of neural networks?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You would usually extract features from the data and feed those to the
network. It is not advisable to take just some data and feed it to net. In
practice, pre-processing and choosing the right features will decide over your
success and the performance of the neural net. Unfortunately, IMHO it takes
experience to develop a sense for that and it's nothing one can learn from a
book.</p>
<p>Summing up: "Garbage in, garbage out"</p>
