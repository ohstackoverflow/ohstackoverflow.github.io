    <p>There are many papers about ranged combat artificial intelligences, like
Killzones's (see this paper), or Halo. But I've not been able to find much
about a fighting IA except for this work, which uses neural networs to learn
how to fight, which is not exactly what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Occidental AI in games is heavily focused on FPS, it seems! Does anyone know
which techniques are used to implement a decent fighting AI? Hierarchical
Finite State Machines? Decision Trees? They could end up being pretty
predictable.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In our research labs, we are using AI planning technology for games. AI
Planning is used by NASA to build semi-autonomous robots. Planning can produce
less predictable behavior than state machines, but planning is a highly
complex problem, that is, solving planning problems has a huge computational
complexity.</p>
<p>AI Planning is an old but interesting field. Particularly for gaming only
recently people have started using planning to run their engines. The
expressiveness is still limited in the current implementations, but in theory
the expressiveness is limited "only by our imagination".</p>
<p>Russel and Norvig have devoted 4 chapters on AI Planning in their book on
Artificial Intelligence. Other related terms you might be interested in are:
Markov Decision Processes, Bayesian Networks. These topics are also provided
sufficient exposure in this book.</p>
<p>If you are looking for some ready-made engine to easily start using, I guess
using AI Planning would be a gross overkill. I don't know of any AI Planning
engine for games but we are developing one. If you are interested in the long
term, we can talk separately about it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You seem to know already the techniques for planning and executing. Another
thing that you need to do is predict the opponent's next move and maximize the
expected reward of your response. I wrote a blog article about this:
http://www.masterbaboon.com/2009/05/my-ai-reads-your-mind-and-kicks-your-ass-
part-2/ and http://www.masterbaboon.com/2009/09/my-ai-reads-your-mind-
extensions-part-3/ . The game I consider is <em>very</em> simple, but I think the
main ideas from Bayesian decision theory might be useful for your project.</p>

    <p>Behind the tables and tables of raw data, how does Wolfram Alpha work?</p>
<p>I imagine there are various artificial intelligence mechanisms driving the
site but I can't fathom how anyone would put something like this together. Are
there any explanations that would help a programmer understand how something
like this is created? Does the knowledge base learn on its own or is it taught
very specific details in a very organized manner? What kind of structure and
language is used to store this type of data?</p>
<p>Obviously this is a huge question and can't fully be answered here but some of
the general concepts would be nice to know so I can build off of them and do
my own research.</p>

<p>This official blog post has some portion of the explanation: the language
Mathematica.</p>

    <p>I'm looking at definitions of the A* path-finding algorithm, and it seems to
be defined somewhat differently in different places.</p>
<p>The difference is in the action performed when going through the successors of
a node, and finding that a successor is on the closed list.</p>
<ul>
<li>One approach (suggested by Wikipedia, and this article) says: if the successor is on the closed list, just ignore it</li>
<li>Another approach (suggested here and here, for example) says: if the successor is on the closed list, examine its cost. If it's higher than the currently computed score, remove the item from the closed list for future examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm confused - which method is correct ? Intuitively, the first makes more
sense to me, but I wonder about the difference in definition. Is one of the
definitions wrong, or are they somehow isomorphic ?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The first approach is optimal only if the optimal path to any repeated state
is always the first to be followed. This property holds if the heuristic
function has the property of <strong>consistency</strong> (also called <strong>monoticity</strong> ). A
heuristic function is consistent if, for every node <code>n</code> and every successor
<code>n'</code> of <code>n</code>, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from <code>n</code> is no greater
than the step cost of getting to <code>n'</code> from <code>n</code> plus the estimated cost of
reaching the goal from <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>The second approach is optimal if the heuristic function is merely admissible,
that is, it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.</p>
<p>Every consistent heuristic function is also admissible. Although consistency
is a stricter requirement than admissibility, one has to work quite hard to
concoct heuristic functions that are admissible but not consistent.</p>
<p>Thus, even though the second approach is more general as it works with a
strictly larger subset of heuristic functions, the first approach is usually
sufficient in practice.</p>

cost</em> in section <em>4.1 Informed (Heuristic) Search Strategies</em> of the book
