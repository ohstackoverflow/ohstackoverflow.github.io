    <p>With the "Implicit" flow the client (likely a browser) will get a access
token, after the Resource Owner (i.e. the user) gave access.</p>
<p>With the "Authorization Code" flow however, the client (usually a web server)
will only get an authorization code after the Resource Owner (i.e. the user)
gave access. With that authorization code the client then makes another call
to the API passing client_id and client_secret together with the authorization
code to obtain the access token. All well described here.</p>
<p>Both flows have the exact same result: an access token. However, the
"Implicit" flow is much simpler.</p>
<p>The question: <strong>Why bother with "Authorization Code" flow, when "Implicit"
flow seems to work just fine? Why not just use "Implicit" for webserver?</strong></p>
<p>It's more work both for the provider and the client.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> This is all because of security reasons.</p>
<p>OAuth 2.0 wanted to meet these two criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to allow developers to use non-HTTPS redirect URI because not all developers have an SSL enabled server and if they do it's not always properly configured (non-self signed, trusted SSL certificates, synchronised server clock...).</li>
<li>You don't want hackers to be able to steal access/refresh tokens by intercepting requests.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Details below:</strong></p>
<p>The implicit flow is only possible in a browser environment because of
security reasons:</p>
<p>In the <strong>implicit flow</strong> the access token is passed directly as a hash
fragment (not as a URL parameter). One important thing about hash fragment is
that, once you follow a link containing a hash fragment, only the browser is
aware of the hash fragment. Browsers will pass the hash fragment directly to
the destination webpage (the redirect URI / the client's webpage). Hash
fragment have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not part of the HTTP request therefore they can't be read by servers and because of that they cannot be intercepted by intermediary servers/routers (this is important).</li>
<li>They only exist on the browser - client side - so the only way to read the hash fragment is using JavaScript that runs on the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it possible to pass an Access Token directly to the client without
the risk of it being intercepted by an intermediary server. This has the
caveat of only being possible client side and needs javascript running client
side to use the access token.</p>
<p>The implicit flow also has security issues that requires further logic to
workaround/avoid for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>An attacker could get an access token from a user on a different website/app (let's say if he is the owner of the other website/app), log the token on their website, and then pass it as a URL param on your website therefore impersonating the user on your website. To avoid this you need to check the Client ID associated with the access token (for instance for Google you can use the tokeninfo endpoint) to make sure the token was issued with your own client ID (i.e by your own app) or check the signature if you are using an IDToken (but that requires your client secret).</li>
<li>If the auth request did not originate from your own property (called Session Fixation attacks), to avoid this you'll want to generate a random hash from your website, save it in a cookie and pass that same hash in the state URL param of the auth request, when the user comes back you check the state param with the cookie and it must match.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>authorization code flow</strong> it is not possible to pass an access token
directly in a URL parameter because URL parameters are part of the HTTP
Request, therefore any intermediary server/routers by which your request would
pass (could be hundreds) could be able to read the access token if you are not
using en encrypted connection (HTTPS) allowing what's known as Man-in-the-
middle attacks.</p>
<p>Passing the access token directly in a URL param could in theory be possible
but the auth sever would have to make sure the redirect URI is using HTTPS
with TLS encryption and a 'trusted' SSL certificate (typically from a
Certificate Authority that is not free) to be sure that the destination server
is legitimate and that the HTTP request is fully encrypted. Having all
developers purchase an SSL certificate and properly configure SSL on their
domain would be a huge pain and would slow adoption down tremendously. This is
why an intermediary one-time-use "authorization code" is provided that only
the legitimate receiver will be able to exchange (because you need the client
secret) and that the code will be useless to potential hackers intercepting
the requests over unencrypted transactions (because they don't know the client
secret).</p>
<p>You could also argue that the implicit flow is less secure, there are
potential attack vectors like spoofing the domain upon redirect - for example
by hijacking the IP address of the client's website. This is one of the
reasons why the implicit flow only grants access tokens (which are supposed to
have a limited time use) and never refresh tokens (which are unlimited in
time). To remedy this issue, I advise you to host your webpages on an HTTPS-
enabled server whenever possible.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The <strong>Implicit Flow makes the whole flow pretty easy, but also less secure</strong>.<br>
As the client application, which is typically JavaScript running within a
Browser is less trusted, no refresh tokens for long-lived access are returned.<br>
You should use this flow for applications that need temporary access (a few
hours) to the user’s data.<br>
Returning an access token to JavaScript clients also means that your browser-
based application needs to take special care – think of XSS Attacks that could
leak the access token to other systems.</p>

    <p>Could you explain ValidateAntiForgeryToken purpose and show me example about
<code>ValidateAntiForgeryToken</code> in MVC 4?</p>
<p>I could not find any examples which explain this attribute?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>MVC's anti-forgery support writes a unique value to an HTTP-only cookie and
then the same value is written to the form. When the page is submitted, an
error is raised if the cookie value doesn't match the form value.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the feature prevents cross site request forgeries.
That is, a form from another site that posts to your site in an attempt to
submit hidden content using an authenticated user's credentials. The attack
involves tricking the logged in user into submitting a form, or by simply
programmatically triggering a form when the page loads.</p>
<p>The feature doesn't prevent any other type of data forgery or tampering based
attacks.</p>
<p>To use it, decorate the action method or controller with the
<code>ValidateAntiForgeryToken</code> attribute and place a call to
<code>@Html.AntiForgeryToken()</code> in the forms posting to the method.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The basic purpose of ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute is to prevent cross-
site request forgery attacks.</p>
<p>A cross-site request forgery is an attack in which a harmful script element,
malicious command, or code is sent from the browser of a trusted user. For
more information on this please visit
http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/security/xsrfcsrf-prevention-in-aspnet-mvc-
and-web-pages.</p>
<p>It is simple to use, you need to decorate method with ValidateAntiForgeryToken
attribute as below:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">HttpPost</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w">  </span>
<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">ValidateAntiForgeryToken</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w">  </span>

<p>It is derived from System.Web.Mvc namespace.</p>
<p>And in your view, add this code to add the token so it is used to validate the
form upon submission.</p>

    <p>I tried searching using Google Search and Stack Overflow, but it didn't show
up any results. I have seen this in opensource library code:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Notification notification = new Notification(icon, tickerText, when);
notification.defaults |= Notification.DEFAULT_SOUND;
notification.defaults |= Notification.DEFAULT_VIBRATE;
</pre></div>

<p>What does "|=" ( <code>pipe equal operator</code> ) mean?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><code>|=</code> reads the same way as <code>+=</code>.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">notification.defaults |= Notification.DEFAULT_SOUND;
</pre></div>

<p>is the same as</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">notification.defaults = notification.defaults | Notification.DEFAULT_SOUND;
</pre></div>

<p>where <code>|</code> is the bit-wise OR operator.</p>
<p>All operators are referenced here.</p>
<p>A bit-wise operator is used because, as is frequent, those constants enable an
int to carry flags.</p>
<p>If you look at those constants, you'll see that they're in powers of two :</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public static final int DEFAULT_SOUND = 1;
public static final int DEFAULT_VIBRATE = 2; // is the same than 1&lt;&lt;1 or 10 in binary
public static final int DEFAULT_LIGHTS = 4; // is the same than 1&lt;&lt;2 or 100 in binary
</pre></div>

<p>So you can use bit-wise OR to add flags</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">int myFlags = DEFAULT_SOUND | DEFAULT_VIBRATE; // same as 001 | 010, producing 011
</pre></div>

<p>so</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">myFlags |= DEFAULT_LIGHTS;
</pre></div>

<p>simply means we add a flag.</p>
<p>And symmetrically, we test a flag is set using <code>&amp;</code> :</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">boolean hasVibrate = (DEFAULT_VIBRATE &amp; myFlags) != 0;
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You have already got sufficient answer for your question. But may be my answer
help you more about <code>|=</code> kind of binary operators.</p>
<p>I am writing table for bitwise operators:<br>
Following are valid:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nb">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c">Operator   Description                                   Example</span>
<span class="nb">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="c">|=        bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator   C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2</span>
<span class="c">^=        bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator   C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2</span>
<span class="c">&amp;=        Bitwise AND assignment operator                C &amp;= 2 is same as C = C &amp; 2</span>
<span class="nv">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="c">=       Left shift AND assignment operator             C </span><span class="nv">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="c">= 2 is same as C = C </span><span class="nv">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="c"> 2</span>
<span class="nv">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="c">=       Right shift AND assignment operator            C </span><span class="nv">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="c">= 2 is same as C = C </span><span class="nv">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="c"> 2  </span>
<span class="nb">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</pre></div>

<p>note all operators are binary operators.</p>
<p>Also <strong>Note:</strong> <em>(for below points I wanted to add my answer)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is bitwise operator in Java that is called <strong>Unsigned shift</strong><br><del>but<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;=</code> not an operator in Java.</del> &gt;&gt;&gt;= operator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>~</code> is bitwise complement bits, <code>0 to 1 and 1 to 0</code> (Unary operator) but <code>~=</code> not an operator. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, <code>!</code> Called Logical NOT Operator, but <code>!=</code> Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. e.g. <code>(A != B) is true</code>. where as <code>A=!B</code> means if <code>B</code> is <code>true</code> then <code>A</code> become <code>false</code> (and if <code>B</code> is <code>false</code> then <code>A</code> become <code>true</code>). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>side note: <em><code>|</code> is not called pipe, instead its called OR, pipe is shell
terminology transfer one process out to next..</em></p>
