    <p>For my graduate research I am creating a neural network that trains to
recognize images. I am going much more complex than just taking a grid of RGB
values, downsampling, and and sending them to the input of the network, like
many examples do. I actually use over 100 independently trained neural
networks that detect features, such as lines, shading patterns, etc. Much more
like the human eye, and it works really well so far! The problem is I have
quite a bit of training data. I show it over 100 examples of what a car looks
like. Then 100 examples of what a person looks like. Then over 100 of what a
dog looks like, etc. This is quite a bit of training data! Currently I am
running at about one week to train the network. This is kind of killing my
progress, as I need to adjust and retrain.</p>
<p>I am using Neuroph, as the low-level neural network API. I am running a dual-
quadcore machine(16 cores with hyperthreading), so this should be fast. My
processor percent is at only 5%. Are there any tricks on Neuroph performance?
Or Java performance in general? Suggestions? I am a cognitive psych doctoral
student, and I am decent as a programmer, but do not know a great deal about
performance programming.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Yeah I went down that road a few months ago. Also for a university project.
First problem is Neuroph. Its deadly slow. Neuroph has well know major
architectural and performance issues, there was just an article about that
last week on code project.</p>
<p>http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/benchmark-neuroph-encog.aspx</p>
<p>I followed a similar path as the author of this article. Switching from
Neuroph to Encog is a real easy port. The author of the above article even has
another that compares the syntax of Encog, JOONE and Neuroph, so you can
compare that. For more info on Encog,</p>
<p>http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog</p>
<p>Encog will take more advantage of your cores too. Just look at the chart in
the above article.</p>
<p>Good luck! Your research sounds really awesome, I would love to see the
results.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Also look at your training method. Multicores help you work FASTER. Working
smarter is good too. If you are just using backpropagation you are going to
take a long time to converge. At a minimum use something like resilient
propagation, I think that might be in Neuroph. Or look at Scaled Conjugate
Gradient or Levenberg Marquardt. Encog does both of these. Encog can also use
your GPU to even further speed things using OpenCL.</p>
<p>Speeding up iterations is good. But doing MORE with a training iteration is
often even better. And doing BOTH is the best of all.</p>
<p>How independent are your neural networks? Honestly, I am the main Encog
programmer and I would love to see you switch. BUT, if you are under a time
crunch and need to stay Neuroph and those nets ARE truly independent, then you
might be able to spawn multiple threads and have several Neuroph training
loops going at once. Over all of your cores. Assuming there is nothing in
Neuroph that is going to goof up when there are several instance of their
trainer going at once. I don't know Neuroph well enough to say how re-entrant
it is.</p>
<p>Also I agree, your research sounds really interesting.</p>

    <p>I want to develop <em>RISK board game</em> , which will include an AI for computer
players. Moreovor, I read two articles, this and this, about it, and I
realised that I must learn about <em>Monte Carlo simulation</em> and <em>Markov chains</em>
techniques. And I thought that I have to use these techniques together, but I
guess they are different techniques relevant to calculate probabilities about
transition states.</p>
<p>So, could anyone explain what are the important differences and advantages and
disadvantages between them?</p>
<p>Finally, which way you will prefer if you would implement an AI for RISK game?</p>
<p>Here you can find simple determined probabilities about outcomes of a battle
in risk board game, and the brute force algorithm used. There is a tree
diagram to which specifies all possible states. Should I use Monte Carlo or
Markov chain on this tree?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Okay, so I skimmed the articles to get a sense of what they were doing. Here
is my overview of the terms you asked about:</p>
<p>A <em>Markov Chain</em> is simply a model of how your system moves from state to
state. Developing a Markov model from scratch can sometimes be difficult, but
once you have one in hand, they're relatively easy to use, and relatively easy
to understand. The basic idea is that your game will have certain states
associated with it; that as part of the game, you will move from state to
state; and, critically, that this movement from state to state happens based
on probability and that you know these probabilities.</p>
<p>Once you have that information, you can represent it all as a graph, where
nodes are states and arcs between states (labelled with probabilities) are
transitions. You can also represent as a matrix that satisfies certain
constraints, or several other more exotic data structures.</p>
<p>The short article is actually all about the Markov Chain approach, but-- and
this is important-- it is using that approach only as a quick means of
estimating what will happen if army A attacks a territory with army B
defending it. It's a nice use of the technique, but it is not an AI for Risk,
it is merely a module in the AI helping to figure out the likely results of an
attack.</p>
<p><em>Monte Carlo</em> techniques, by contrast, are estimators. Once you have a model
of something, whether a Markov model or any other, you often find yourself in
the position of wanting to estimate something about it. (Often it happens to
be something that you can, if you squint hard enough, put into the form of an
integral of something that happens to be very hard to work with in that
format.) Monte Carlo techniques just sample randomly and aggregate the results
into an estimate of what's going to happen.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo techniques are not, in my opinion, AI techniques. They are a very
general purpose technique that happen to be useful for AI, but they are not AI
per se. (You can say the same thing about Markov models, but the statement is
weaker because Markov models are so extremely useful for planning in AI, that
entire philosophies of AI are built around the technique. Markov models are
used elsewhere, though, as well.)</p>
<p>So that is what they are. You also asked which one I would use if I had to
implement a Risk AI. Well, neither of those is going to be sufficient. Monte
Carlo, as I said, is not an AI technique, it's a general math tool. And Markov
Models, while they could in theory represent the entirety of a game of Risk,
are going to end up being very unwieldy: You would need to represent <em>every</em>
state of the game, meaning every possible configuration of armies in
territories and every possible configuration of cards in hands, etc. (I am
glossing over many details, here: There are a lot of other difficulties with
this approach.)</p>
<p>The core of Wolf's thesis is neither the Markov approach nor the Monte Carlo
approach, it is actually what he describes as the evaluation function. This is
the heart of the AI problem: How to figure out what action is best. The Monte
Carlo method in Blatt's paper describes a method to figure out what the
expected result of an action is, but that is not the same as figuring out what
action is best. Moreover, there's a low key statement in Wolf's thesis about
look-ahead being hard to perform in Risk because the game trees become so very
large, which is what led him (I think) to focus so much on the evaluation
function.</p>
<p>So my real advice would be this: Read up on search-tree approaches, like
minimax, alpha-beta pruning and especially expecti-minimax. You can find good
treatments of these early in Russell and Norvig, or even on Wikipedia. Try to
understand why these techniques work in general, but are cumbersome for Risk.
That will lead you to some discussion of board evaluation techniques. Then go
back and look at Wolf's thesis, focusing on his action evaluation function.
And finally, focus on the way he tries to <em>automatically learn</em> a good
evaluation function.</p>
<p>That is a lot of work. But Risk is not an easy game to develop an AI for.</p>
<p>(If you just want to figure out the expected results of a given attack,
though, I'd say go for Monte Carlo. It's clean, very intuitive to understand,
and very easy to implement. The only difficult-- and it's not a big one-- is
making sure you run enough trials to get a good result.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Markov chains are simply a set of transitions and their probabilities,
assuming no memory of past events.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations are repeated samplings of random walks over a set of
probabilities.</p>
<p>You can use both together by using a Markov chain to model your probabilities
and then a Monte Carlo simulation to examine the expected outcomes.</p>
<p>For Risk I don't think I would use Markov chains because I don't see an
advantage. A Monte Carlo analysis of your possible moves could help you come
up with a pretty good AI in conjunction with a suitable fitness function.</p>
<p>I know this glossed over a lot but I hope it helped.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>It's a whole topic of discussion but I'll try to explain you one simple
example.</p>
<p>Input of your algorithm is <strong>KB</strong> - set of rules to perform resolution. It
easy to understand that as set of facts like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple is red</li>
<li>
<em>If</em> smth is red <em>Then</em> this smth is sweet</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduce two predicates <code>R(x)</code> - (<code>x</code> <em>is red</em> ) and <code>S(x)</code> - (<code>x</code> <em>is
sweet</em> ). Than we can written our facts in formal language:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>R('apple')</code></li>
<li><code>R(X) -&gt; S(X)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>We can substitute 2nd fact as <code>¬R v S</code> to be eligible for resolution rule.</p>
<p>Caluclating resolvents step in your programs delete two opposite facts:</p>
<p>Examples: 1) <code>a &amp; ¬a -&gt; empty</code>. 2) <code>a('b') &amp; ¬a(x) v s(x) -&gt; S('b')</code></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that in second example variable <code>x</code> substituted with actual value
<code>'b'</code>.</p>
<p>The goal of our program to determine if sentence <strong>apple is sweet</strong> is true.
We write this sentence also in formal language as <code>S('apple')</code> and ask it in
inverted state. Then formal definition of problem is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CLAUSE1</strong> = <code>R('apple')</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CLAUSE2</strong> = <code>¬R(X) v S(X)</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Goal?</strong> = <code>¬S('apple')</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take clause c1 and c2</li>
<li>calculate resolvents for c1 and c2 gives new clause c3 = <code>S('apple')</code>
</li>
<li>calculate resolvents for c3 and goal gives us empty set.</li>
</ol>
<p>That means our sentence is true. If you can't get empty set with such
resolutions that means sentence is false (but for most cases in practical
applications it's a lack of KB facts).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Consider clauses X and Y, with X = {a, x1, x2, ..., xm} and Y = {~a, y1, y2,
..., yn}, where a is a variable, ~a is its negation, and the xi and yi are
literals (i.e., possibly-negated variables).</p>
<p>The interpretation of X is the proposition (a \/ x1 \/ x2 \/ ... \/ xm) --
that is, at least one of a or one of the xi must be true, assuming X is true.
Likewise for Y.</p>
<p>We assume that X and Y are true.</p>
<p>We also know that (a \/ ~a) is always true, regardless of the value of a.</p>
<p>If ~a is true, then a is false, so ~a /\ X =&gt; {x1, x2, ..., xm}.</p>
<p>If a is true, then ~a is false. In this case a /\ Y =&gt; {y1, y2, ..., yn}.</p>
<p>We know, therefore, that {x1, x2, ..., xm, y1, y2, ..., yn} must be true,
assuming X and Y are true. Observe that the new clause does not refer to
variable a.</p>
<p>This kind of deduction is known as resolution.</p>
<p>How does this work in a resolution based theorem prover? Simple: we use proof
by contradiction. That is, we start by turning our "facts" into clauses and
add the clauses corresponding to the negation of our "goal". Then, if we can
eventually resolve to the empty clause, {}, we will have reached a
contradiction since the empty clause is equivalent to falsity. Because the
facts are given, this means that our negated goal must be wrong, hence the
(unnegated) goal must be true.</p>
