    <p>I have been developing an app for 1 or 2 weeks now and just yesterday I have
updated my iPhone 5S to the iOS 8 GM. Everything worked fine and I could test
on my device as well until I deleted the app from my phone and wanted to build
again. The following error appeared:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Could not launch "My App"
process launch failed: Security
</pre></div>

<p><img alt="Screenshot added" src="images/TzLwB.png"></p>
<p>When I test with the simulator it works fine. Is this because of the iOS 8 GM
update and how can I fix this launch problem? I want to be able to test on my
iPhone and in the simulator.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>If you get this, the app has installed on your device. You have to tap the
icon. It will ask you if you <em>really</em> want to run it. Say “<code>yes</code>” and then
<code>Build &amp; Run again</code>.</p>
<p>As from <code>iOS 9</code>, it is required to go to <code>Settings</code> → <code>General</code> → <code>Device
Management</code> → <code>Developer App</code> → `Trust``.</p>
<p>On <em>some</em> versions of <code>iOS</code>, you will have to go to <code>Settings</code> → <code>General</code> →
<code>Profile</code> instead.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Updated answer for Xcode 7</strong> : Tapping the app no longer works (as of beta 1
it just displays an "untrusted enterprise developer" message with only a
Dismiss button).</p>
<p>To fix, open the Settings app, go to General / Profiles, and you'll see your
profile. Mark it trusted and things should start working normally again.</p>
<p><strong>Updated For iOS 9.2.1 and Xcode 7.2.1:</strong></p>
<p>Goto: Settings &gt; General &gt; Device Management &gt; Select App from Developer Apps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust App.</p>

    <p>I've been hearing a lot about the PyPy project. They claim it is 6.3 times
faster than the CPython interpreter on their site.</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about dynamic languages like Python, speed is one of the top
issues. To solve this, they say PyPy is 6.3 times faster.</p>
<p>The second issue is parallelism, the infamous Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
For this, PyPy says it can give GIL-less Python.</p>
<p>If PyPy can solve these great challenges, what are its weaknesses that are
preventing wider adoption? That is to say, what's preventing someone like me,
a typical Python developer, from switching to PyPy <em>right now</em>?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> PyPy is more mature and better supported now than it was in 2013,
when this question was asked. Avoid drawing conclusions from out-of-date
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>PyPy, as others have been quick to mention, has tenuous support for C extensions. It has support, but typically at slower-than-Python speeds and it's iffy at best. Hence a lot of modules simply require CPython. <del>PyPy doesn't support numpy</del>. Some extensions are still not supported ( <del>Pandas</del> , <del>SciPy</del> , etc.), take a look at the list of supported packages before making the change. <strong>Note that many packages marked unsupported on the list are now supported.</strong>
</li>
<li>Python 3 support <del>is experimental at the moment.</del> <strong>has just reached stable! As of 20th June 2014, PyPy3 2.3.1 - Fulcrum is out!</strong>
</li>
<li>PyPy sometimes isn't actually faster for "scripts", which a lot of people use Python for. These are the short-running programs that do something simple and small. Because PyPy is a JIT compiler its main advantages come from long run times and simple types (such as numbers). PyPy's pre-JIT speeds can be bad compared to CPython.</li>
<li>
<strong>Inertia</strong>. Moving to PyPy often requires retooling, which for some people and organizations is simply too much work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the main reasons that affect me, I'd say.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>That site does <strong>not</strong> claim PyPy is 6.3 times faster than CPython. To quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The geometric average of all benchmarks is 0.16 or 6.3 times faster than
CPython</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <strong>very</strong> different statement to the blanket statement you made, and
when you understand the difference, you'll understand at least one set of
reasons why you can't just say "use PyPy". It might sound like I'm nit-
picking, but understanding why these two statements are totally different is
vital.</p>
<p>To break that down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The statement they make only applies to the benchmarks they've used. It says absolutely nothing about your program (unless your program is exactly the same as one of their benchmarks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statement is about an <strong>average</strong> of a group of benchmarks. There is no claim that running PyPy will give a 6.3 times improvement even for the programs they have tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no claim that PyPy will even run all the programs that CPython runs <strong>at all</strong> , let alone faster.</p>
</li>

    <p>I've heard that the <code>static_cast</code> function should be preferred to C-style or
simple function-style casting. Is this true? Why?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The main reason is that classic C casts make no distinction between what we
call <code>static_cast&lt;&gt;()</code>, <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()</code>, <code>const_cast&lt;&gt;()</code>, and
<code>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;()</code>. These four things are completely different.</p>
<p>A <code>static_cast&lt;&gt;()</code> is usually safe. There is a valid conversion in the
language, or an appropriate constructor that makes it possible. The only time
it's a bit risky is when you cast down to an inherited class; you must make
sure that the object is actually the descendant that you claim it is, by means
external to the language (like a flag in the object). A <code>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;()</code> is
safe as long as the result is checked (pointer) or a possible exception is
taken into account (reference).</p>
<p>A <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()</code> (or a <code>const_cast&lt;&gt;()</code>) on the other hand is always
dangerous. You tell the compiler: "trust me: I know this doesn't look like a
<code>foo</code> (this looks as if it isn't mutable), but it is".</p>
<p>The first problem is that it's almost impossible to tell which one will occur
in a C-style cast without looking at large and disperse pieces of code and
knowing all the rules.</p>
<p>Let's assume these:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">CDerivedClass</span> : <span class="n">public</span> <span class="n">CMyBase</span> {...};
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">CMyOtherStuff</span> {...} ;

<span class="n">CMyBase</span>  *<span class="n">pSomething</span>; // <span class="n">filled</span> <span class="n">somewhere</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, these two are compiled the same way:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">CDerivedClass *pMyObject;
pMyObject = static_cast&lt;CDerivedClass*&gt;(pSomething); // Safe; as long as we checked

pMyObject = (CDerivedClass*)(pSomething); // Same as static_cast&lt;&gt;
                                     // Safe; as long as we checked
                                     // but harder to read
</pre></div>

<p>However, let's see this almost identical code:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">CMyOtherStuff</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nt">pOther</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="nt">pOther</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">static_cast</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">CMyOtherStuff</span><span class="o">*&gt;(</span><span class="nt">pSomething</span><span class="o">);</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">Compiler</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">error</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">Can</span><span class="s1">'t convert</span>

<span class="s1">pOther = (CMyOtherStuff*)(pSomething);            // No compiler error.</span>
<span class="s1">                                                  // Same as reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;</span>
<span class="s1">                                                  // and it'</span><span class="nt">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">wrong</span><span class="o">!!!</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, there is no easy way to distinguish between the two situations
without knowing a lot about all the classes involved.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the C-style casts are too hard to locate. In
complex expressions it can be very hard to see C-style casts. It is virtually
impossible to write an automated tool that needs to locate C-style casts (for
example a search tool) without a full blown C++ compiler front-end. On the
other hand, it's easy to search for "static_cast&lt;" or "reinterpret_cast&lt;".</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">pOther = reinterpret_cast&lt;CMyOtherStuff*&gt;(pSomething);
      // No compiler error.
      // but the presence of a reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt; is 
      // like a Siren with Red Flashing Lights in your code.
      // The mere typing of it should cause you to feel VERY uncomfortable.
</pre></div>

<p>That means that, not only are C-style casts more dangerous, but it's a lot
harder to find them all to make sure that they are correct.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>One pragmatic tip: you can search easily for the <code>static_cast</code> keyword in your
source code if you plan to tidy up the project.</p>
