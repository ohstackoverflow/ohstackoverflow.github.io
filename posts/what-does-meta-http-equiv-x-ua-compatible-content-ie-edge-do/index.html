<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><em><strong>November 2021 Update</strong></em></p>
<p>As this answer is now 10+ years old my recommendation would be to leave this
tag out altogether, unless you must support old legacy browsers.</p>
<p><em><strong>October 2015 Update</strong></em></p>
<p>This answer was posted several years ago and now the question really should be
<em>should you even consider using the<code>X-UA-Compatible</code> tag on your site?</em> with
the changes Microsoft has made to its browsers (more on those below).</p>
<p>Depending upon what Microsoft browsers you support you may not need to
continue using the <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> tag. If you need to support IE9 or IE8,
then I would recommend using the tag. If you only support the latest browsers
(IE11 and/or Edge) then I would consider dropping this tag altogether. If you
use Twitter Bootstrap and need to eliminate validation warnings, this tag must
appear in its specified order. Additional info below:</p>
<hr>
<p>The <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> meta tag allows web authors to choose what version of
Internet Explorer the page should be rendered as. IE11 has made changes to
these modes; see the IE11 note below. Microsoft Edge, the browser that
replaced IE11, only honors the <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> meta tag in certain
circumstances. See the Microsoft Edge note below.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, when using the <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> tag, it should be as
high as possible in your document <code>head</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are using the X-UA-Compatible META tag you want to place it as close
to the top of the page's HEAD as possible. Internet Explorer begins
interpreting markup using the latest version. When Internet Explorer
encounters the X-UA-Compatible META tag it starts over using the designated
version's engine. This is a performance hit because the browser must stop
and restart analyzing the content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are your options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"IE=edge"</li>
<li>"IE=11"</li>
<li>"IE=EmulateIE11"</li>
<li>"IE=10"</li>
<li>"IE=EmulateIE10"</li>
<li>"IE=9"</li>
<li>"IE=EmulateIE9</li>
<li>"IE=8"</li>
<li>"IE=EmulateIE8"</li>
<li>"IE=7"</li>
<li>"IE=EmulateIE7"</li>
<li>"IE=5"</li>
</ul>
<p>To attempt to understand what each means, here are definitions provided by
Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internet Explorer supports a number of document compatibility modes that
enable different features and can affect the way content is displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Edge mode tells Internet Explorer to display content in the highest mode
available. With Internet Explorer 9, this is equivalent to IE9 mode. If a
future release of Internet Explorer supported a higher compatibility mode,
pages set to edge mode would appear in the highest mode supported by that
version. Those same pages would still appear in IE9 mode when viewed with
Internet Explorer 9. Internet Explorer supports a number of document
compatibility modes that enable different features and can affect the way
content is displayed:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IE11 mode provides the highest support available for established and
emerging industry standards, including the HTML5, CSS3 and others.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IE10 mode provides the highest support available for established and
emerging industry standards, including the HTML5, CSS3 and others.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IE9 mode provides the highest support available for established and
emerging industry standards, including the HTML5 (Working Draft), W3C
Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 Specification (Working Draft), Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0 Specification, and others. [Editor Note: IE 9
<em>does not</em> support CSS3 animations].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IE8 mode supports many established standards, including the W3C
Cascading Style Sheets Level 2.1 Specification and the W3C Selectors API; it
also provides limited support for the W3C Cascading Style Sheets Level 3
Specification (Working Draft) and other emerging standards.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IE7 mode renders content as if it were displayed in standards mode by
Internet Explorer 7, whether or not the page contains a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;
directive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emulate IE9 mode tells Internet Explorer to use the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; directive
to determine how to render content. Standards mode directives are displayed
in IE9 mode and quirks mode directives are displayed in IE5 mode. Unlike IE9
mode, Emulate IE9 mode respects the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; directive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emulate IE8 mode tells Internet Explorer to use the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; directive
to determine how to render content. Standards mode directives are displayed
in IE8 mode and quirks mode directives are displayed in IE5 mode. Unlike IE8
mode, Emulate IE8 mode respects the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; directive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emulate IE7 mode tells Internet Explorer to use the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; directive
to determine how to render content. Standards mode directives are displayed
in Internet Explorer 7 standards mode and quirks mode directives are
displayed in IE5 mode. Unlike IE7 mode, Emulate IE7 mode respects the
&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; directive. For many web sites, this is the preferred
compatibility mode.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IE5 mode renders content as if it were displayed in quirks mode by
Internet Explorer 7, which is very similar to the way content was displayed
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>IE10 NOTE:</strong></em> As of IE10, quirks mode behaves differently than it did in
earlier versions of the browser. In IE9 and earlier versions, quirks mode
restricted the webpage to the features supported by IE5.5. In IE10, quirks
mode conforms to the differences specified in the HTML5 specification.</p>
<p>Personally, I always choose the <code>http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"
content="IE=edge"</code> meta tag, as older versions have plenty of bugs, and I do
not want IE to decide to go into "Compatibility mode" and show my site as IE7
vs IE8 or 9. I always prefer the latest version of IE.</p>
<p><em><strong>IE11</strong></em></p>
<p>From Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with IE11, edge mode is the preferred document mode; it represents
the highest support for modern standards available to the browser.</p>
<p>Use the HTML5 document type declaration to enable edge mode:</p>
<p><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code></p>
<p>Edge mode was introduced in Internet Explorer 8 and has been available in
each subsequent release. Note that the features supported by edge mode are
limited to those supported by the specific version of the browser rendering
the content.</p>
<p>Starting with IE11, document modes are deprecated and should no longer be
used, except on a temporary basis. Make sure to update sites that rely on
legacy features and document modes to reflect modern standards.</p>
<p>If you must target a specific document mode so that your site functions
while you rework it to support modern standards and features, be aware that
you're using a transitional feature, one that may not be available in future
versions.</p>
<p>If you currently use the x-ua-compatible header to target a legacy document
mode, it's possible your site won't reflect the best experience available
with IE11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Microsoft Edge (Replacement for Internet Explorer that comes bundled with
Windows 10)</strong></em></p>
<p>Information on <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> meta tag for the "Edge" version of IE. From
Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Introducing the “living” Edge document mode</strong></p>
<p>As we announced in August 2013, we are deprecating document modes as of
IE11. With our latest platform updates, the need for legacy document modes
is primarily limited to Enterprise legacy web apps. With new architectural
changes, these legacy document modes will be isolated from changes in the
“living” Edge mode, which will help to guarantee a much higher level of
compatibility for customers who depend on those modes and help us move even
faster on improvements in Edge. IE will still honor document modes served by
intranet sites, sites on the Compatibility View list, and when used with
Enterprise Mode only.</p>
<p>Public Internet sites will be rendered with the new Edge mode platform
(ignoring X-UA-Compatible). It is our goal that Edge is the "living"
document mode from here out and no further document modes will be introduced
going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the changes in Microsoft Edge to no longer support document modes in most
cases, Microsoft has a tool to scan your site to check and see if it has code
that is not compatible with Edge.</p>
<p><em><strong>Chrome=1 Info for IE</strong></em></p>
<p>There is also <code>chrome=1</code> that you can use or use together with one of the
above options like: <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"
content="IE=Edge,chrome=1"&gt;</code>. <code>chrome=1</code> is for Google's Chrome Frame which is
defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Chrome Frame is an open source browser plug-in. Users who have the
plug-in installed have access to Google Chrome's open web technologies and
speedy JavaScript engine when they open pages in the browser.</p>
<p>Google Chrome Frame seamlessly enhances your browsing experience in Internet
Explorer. It displays Google Chrome Frame enabled sites using Google
Chrome’s rendering technology, giving you access to the latest HTML5
features as well as Google Chrome’s performance and security features
without in any way interrupting your usual browser usage.</p>
<p>When Google Chrome Frame is installed, the web just gets better without you
having to think about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But for that plug-in to work you must use <code>chrome=1</code> in the <code>X-UA-Compatible</code>
meta tag.</p>
<p>More info on Chrome Frame can be found here.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Google Chrome Frame only works for IE6 through IE9, and was retired
on February 25, 2014. More info can be found here. Thanks to @mck for the
link.</p>
<p><em><strong>Validation:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>HTML5</strong> :</p>
<p>The page will validate using the W3 Validator only when using <code>&lt;meta http-
equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge"&gt;</code>. For other values it will throw
the error: <code>A meta element with an http-equiv attribute whose value is X-UA-
Compatible must have a content attribute with the value IE=edge.</code> In other
words, if you have <code>IE=edge,chrome=1</code> it will not validate. I ignore this
error completely as modern browsers simply ignore this line of code.</p>
<p>If you must have completely valid code then consider doing this on the server
level by setting HTTP header. As a note, Microsoft says, <code>If both of these
instructions are sent (meta and HTTP), the developer's preference (meta
element) takes precedence over the web server setting (HTTP header).</code> See
olibre's answer or bitinn's answer for more details on how to set an HTTP
header.</p>
<p><strong>XHTML</strong></p>
<p>There isn't an issue with validation when using <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-
Compatible" content="IE=Edge" /&gt;</code> as long as the tag is properly closed (i.e.
<code>/&gt;</code> vs <code>&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Bootstrap (V3 and below)</strong></p>
<p>This tag has been strongly recommended by the Bootstrap team since at least
2014, and Bootlint, the linter authored by the twbs team continues to throw a
warning when the tag is omitted. The linter distinguishes between warnings and
errors, and as such the severity of omitting this tag may be considered minor.</p>

Document Compatibility.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Use <code>content=</code> <strong><code>"IE=edge,chrome=1"</code></strong> Skip other <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> modes</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1"&gt;
                                   --------------------------
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No compatibility icon</strong> <br>
The IE9 Address bar does not show up the Compatibility View button<br>
and the page does not also show up a jumble of out-of-place menus, images, and
text boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Features</strong> <br>
This meta tag is required to enable <code>javascript::JSON.parse()</code> on IE8<br>
(even when <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is present)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correctness</strong> <br>
Rendering/Execution of modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript is more valid (nicer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong> <br>
The Trident rendering engine should run faster in its <em>edge</em> mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Microsoft recommends <em>Edge mode</em> since IE11</h3>
<p>As noticed by Lynda (see comments), the Compatibility changes in IE11
recommends <em>Edge mode</em> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with IE11, edge mode is the preferred document mode; it represents
the highest support for modern standards available to the browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>But the position of Microsoft was not clear.</strong> Another MSDN page did not
recommend <em>Edge mode</em> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because Edge mode forces all pages to be opened in standards mode,
regardless of the version of Internet Explorer, you might be tempted to use
this for all pages viewed with Internet Explorer. Don't do this, as the
<code>X-UA-Compatible</code> header is only supported starting with Windows Internet
Explorer 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, Microsoft recommended using <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want all supported versions of Internet Explorer to open your pages
in standards mode, use the HTML5 document type declaration [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Ricardo explains (in the comments below) any DOCTYPE (HTML4, XHTML1...) can
be used to trigger Standards Mode, not only HTML5's DOCTYPE. The important
thing is to always have a DOCTYPE in the page.</p>
<p>Clara Onager has even noticed in an older version of Specifying legacy
document modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edge mode is intended for testing purposes only; do not use it in a
production environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is so confusing that Usman Y thought Clara Onager was speaking about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The [...] example is provided for illustrative purposes only; don't use it
in a production environment.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7,9,10" &gt;
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Well... In the rest of this answer I give more explanations why
using<code>content="IE=edge,chrome=1"</code> is a good practice in production.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>For many years (2000 to 2008), IE market share was more than 80%. And IE
<strong>v6</strong> was considered as a <em>de facto</em> standard (80% to 97% market share in
2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 for IE6 only, more market share with all IE
versions).</p>
<p>As IE6 was not respecting Web standards, developers <strong>had</strong> to test their
website using IE6. That situation was great for Microsoft (MS) as web
developers had to <strong>buy</strong> MS products (e.g. IE cannot be used without buying
Windows), and it was more profit-making to stay non-compliant (i.e. Microsoft
wanted to become <strong>the</strong> standard excluding other companies).</p>
<p>Therefore many many sites were IE6 compliant only, and as IE was not compliant
with web standard, all these web sites was not well rendered on standards
compliant browsers. Even worse, many sites required only IE.</p>
<p>However, at this time, Mozilla started Firefox development respecting as much
as possible all the web standards (other browser were implemented to render
pages as done by IE6). As more and more web developers wanted to use the new
web standards features, more and more websites were more supported by Firefox
than IE.</p>
<p>When IE market sharing was decreasing, MS realized staying standard
incompatible was not a good idea. Therefore MS started to release new IE
version (IE8/IE9/IE10) respecting more and more the web standards.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The web-incompatible issue</h3>
<p>But the issue is all the websites designed for IE6: Microsoft could not
release new IE versions incompatible with these old IE6-designed websites.
Instead of deducing the IE version a website has been designed, MS requested
developers to add extra data (<code>X-UA-Compatible</code>) in their pages.</p>
<h3>IE6 is still used in 2016</h3>
<p>Nowadays, IE6 is still used (0.7% in 2016) (4.5% in January 2014), and some
internet websites are still IE6-only-compliant. Some intranet
website/applications are tested using IE6. Some intranet website are 100%
functional only on IE6. These companies/departments prefer to postpone the
migration cost: other priorities, nobody no longer knows how the
website/application has been implemented, the owner of the legacy
website/application went bankrupt...</p>
<p>China represents 50% of IE6 usage in 2013, but it may change in the next years
as Chinese Linux distribution is being broadcast.</p>
<h3>Be confident with your web skills</h3>
<p>If you (try to) respect web standard, you can simply always use <code>http-
equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1"</code>. To keep compatibility
with old browsers, just avoid using latest web features: use the subset
supported by the oldest browser you want to support. Or If you want to go
further, you may adopt concepts as Graceful degradation, Progressive
enhancement and Unobtrusive JavaScript. (You may also be pleased to read What
should a web developer consider?.)</p>
<p>Do do not care about the best IE version rendering: this is not your job as
browsers have to be compliant with web standards. If your site is standard
compliant and use moderately latest features, therefore <strong>browsers have to be
compliant with your website</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover, as there are many campaigns to <em>kill</em> IE6 (IE6 no more, MS
campaign), nowadays you may avoid wasting time with IE testing!</p>
<h3>Personal IE6 experience</h3>
<p>In 2009-2012, I worked for a company using IE6 as the <em>official single browser
allowed</em>. I had to implement an intranet website for IE6 only. I decided to
respect web standard but using the IE6-capable subset (HTML/CSS/JS).</p>
<p>It was hard, but when the company switched to IE8, the website was still well
rendered because I had used Firefox and firebug to check the web-standard
compatibility ;)</p>
