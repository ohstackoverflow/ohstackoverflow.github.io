    <p>What is the difference between a <code>DateTime</code> and a <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and when
should one be used?</p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, we have a standard way of dealing with .NET <code>DateTime</code>s in a
TimeZone-aware way: Whenever we produce a <code>DateTime</code> we do it in UTC (e.g.
using <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code>), and whenever we display one, we convert back from
UTC to the user's local time.</p>
<p>That works fine, but I've been reading about <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and how it
captures the local and UTC time in the object itself.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><code>DateTimeOffset</code> is a representation of <em>instantaneous time</em> (also known as
<em>absolute time</em> ). By that, I mean a moment in time that is universal for
everyone (not accounting for leap seconds, or the relativistic effects of time
dilation). Another way to represent instantaneous time is with a <code>DateTime</code>
where <code>.Kind</code> is <code>DateTimeKind.Utc</code>.</p>
<p>This is distinct from <em>calendar time</em> (also known as <em>civil time</em> ), which is
a position on someone's calendar, and there are many different calendars all
over the globe. We call these calendars <em>time zones</em>. Calendar time is
represented by a <code>DateTime</code> where <code>.Kind</code> is <code>DateTimeKind.Unspecified</code>, or
<code>DateTimeKind.Local</code>. And <code>.Local</code> is only meaningful in scenarios where you
have an implied understanding of where the computer that is using the result
is positioned. (For example, a user's workstation)</p>
<p>So then, why <code>DateTimeOffset</code> instead of a UTC <code>DateTime</code>? <strong>It's all about
perspective.</strong> Let's use an analogy - we'll pretend to be photographers.</p>
<p>Imagine you are standing on a calendar timeline, pointing a camera at a person
on the instantaneous timeline laid out in front of you. You line up your
camera according to the rules of your timezone - which change periodically due
to daylight saving time, or due to other changes to the legal definition of
your time zone. (You don't have a steady hand, so your camera is shaky.)</p>
<p>The person standing in the photo would see the angle at which your camera came
from. If others were taking pictures, they could be from different angles.
This is what the <code>Offset</code> part of the <code>DateTimeOffset</code> represents.</p>
<p>So if you label your camera "Eastern Time", sometimes you are pointing from
-5, and sometimes you are pointing from -4. There are cameras all over the
world, all labeled different things, and all pointing at the same
instantaneous timeline from different angles. Some of them are right next to
(or on top of) each other, so just knowing the offset isn't enough to
determine which timezone the time is related to.</p>
<p>And what about UTC? Well, it's the one camera out there that is guaranteed to
have a steady hand. It's on a tripod, firmly anchored into the ground. It's
not going anywhere. We call its angle of perspective the zero offset.</p>
<p><img alt="Instantaneous Time vs Calendar Time Visualization" src="../../images/QE5xq.png"></p>
<p>So - what does this analogy tell us? It provides some intuitive guidelines-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are representing time relative to some place in particular, represent it in calendar time with a <code>DateTime</code>. Just be sure you don't ever confuse one calendar with another. <code>Unspecified</code> should be your assumption. <code>Local</code> is only useful coming from <code>DateTime.Now</code>. For example, I might get <code>DateTime.Now</code> and save it in a database - but when I retrieve it, I have to assume that it is <code>Unspecified</code>. I can't rely that my local calendar is the same calendar that it was originally taken from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you must always be certain of the moment, make sure you are representing instantaneous time. Use <code>DateTimeOffset</code> to enforce it, or use UTC <code>DateTime</code> by convention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to track a moment of instantaneous time, but you want to also know "What time did the user think it was on their local calendar?" - then you <em>must</em> use a <code>DateTimeOffset</code>. This is very important for timekeeping systems, for example - both for technical and legal concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you ever need to modify a previously recorded <code>DateTimeOffset</code> - you don't have enough information in the offset alone to ensure that the new offset is still relevant for the user. You must <em>also</em> store a timezone identifier (think - I need the name of that camera so I can take a new picture even if the position has changed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also be pointed out that Noda Time has a representation called
<code>ZonedDateTime</code> for this, while the .Net base class library does not have
anything similar. You would need to store both a <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and a
<code>TimeZoneInfo.Id</code> value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally, you will want to represent a calendar time that is local to "whomever is looking at it". For example, when defining what <em>today</em> means. Today is always midnight to midnight, but these represent a near-infinite number of overlapping ranges on the instantaneous timeline. (In practice we have a finite number of timezones, but you can express offsets down to the tick) So in these situations, make sure you understand how to either limit the "who's asking?" question down to a single time zone, or deal with translating them back to instantaneous time as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few other little bits about <code>DateTimeOffset</code> that back up this
analogy, and some tips for keeping it straight:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you compare two <code>DateTimeOffset</code> values, they are first normalized to zero offset before comparing. In other words, <code>2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</code> and <code>2012-01-01T02:00:00+02:00</code> refer to the same instantaneous moment, and are therefore equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are doing any unit testing and need to be certain of the offset, test <em>both</em> the <code>DateTimeOffset</code> value, and the <code>.Offset</code> property separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a one-way implicit conversion built in to the .Net framework that lets you pass a <code>DateTime</code> into any <code>DateTimeOffset</code> parameter or variable. When doing so, <strong>the<code>.Kind</code> matters</strong>. If you pass a UTC kind, it will carry in with a zero offset, but if you pass either <code>.Local</code> or <code>.Unspecified</code>, it will assume to be <strong>local</strong>. The framework is basically saying, "Well, you asked me to convert calendar time to instantaneous time, but I have no idea where this came from, so I'm just going to use the local calendar." This is a huge gotcha if you load up an unspecified <code>DateTime</code> on a computer with a different timezone. (IMHO - that should throw an exception - but it doesn't.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shameless Plug:</strong></p>
<p>Many people have shared with me that they find this analogy extremely
valuable, so I included it in my Pluralsight course, Date and Time
Fundamentals. You'll find a step-by-step walkthrough of the camera analogy in
the second module, "Context Matters", in the clip titled "Calendar Time vs.
Instantaneous Time".</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>From Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These uses for DateTimeOffset values are much more common than those for
DateTime values. As a result, DateTimeOffset should be considered the
default date and time type for application development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>source: "Choosing Between DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, and
TimeZoneInfo", <em>MSDN</em></p>
<p>We use <code>DateTimeOffset</code> for nearly everything as our application deals with
particular points in time (e.g. when a record was created/updated). As a side
note, we use <code>DATETIMEOFFSET</code> in SQL Server 2008 as well.</p>
<p>I see <code>DateTime</code> as being useful when you want to deal with dates only, times
only, or deal with either in a generic sense. For example, if you have an
alarm that you want to go off every day at 7 am, you could store that in a
<code>DateTime</code> utilizing a <code>DateTimeKind</code> of <code>Unspecified</code> because you want it to
go off at 7am regardless of DST. But if you want to represent the history of
alarm occurrences, you would use <code>DateTimeOffset</code>.</p>
<p>Use caution when using a mix of <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and <code>DateTime</code> especially
when assigning and comparing between the types. Also, only compare <code>DateTime</code>
instances that are the same <code>DateTimeKind</code> because <code>DateTime</code> ignores timezone
offset when comparing.</p>
