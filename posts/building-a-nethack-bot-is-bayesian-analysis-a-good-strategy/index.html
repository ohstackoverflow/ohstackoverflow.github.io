    <p>A friend of mine is beginning to build a NetHack bot (a bot that plays the
Roguelike game: NetHack). There is a very good working bot for the similar
game Angband, but it works partially because of the ease in going back to the
town and always being able to scum low levels to gain items.</p>
<p>In NetHack, the problem is much more difficult, because the game rewards
ballsy experimentation and is built basically as 1,000 edge cases.</p>
<p>Recently I suggested using some kind of naive bayesian analysis, in very much
the same way spam is created.</p>
<p>Basically the bot would at first build a corpus, by trying every possible
action with every item or creature it finds and storing that information with,
for instance, how close to a death, injury of negative effect it was. Over
time it seems like you could generate a reasonably playable model.</p>
<p>Can anyone point us in the right direction of what a good start would be? Am I
barking up the wrong tree or misunderstanding the idea of bayesian analysis?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> My friend put up a github repo of his NetHack patch that allows
python bindings. It's still in a pretty primitive state but if anyone's
interested...</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Although Bayesian analysis encompasses much more, the Naive Bayes algorithm
well known from spam filters is based on one very fundamental assumption: all
variables are essentially independent of each other. So for instance, in spam
filtering each word is usually treated as a variable so this means assuming
that if the email contains the word 'viagra', that knowledge does affect the
probability that it will also contain the word 'medicine' (or 'foo' or 'spam'
or anything else). The interesting thing is that this assumption is quite
obviously false when it comes to natural language but still manages to produce
reasonable results.</p>
<p>Now one way people sometimes get around the independence assumption is to
define variables that are technically combinations of things (like searching
for the token 'buy viagra'). That can work if you know specific cases to look
for but in general, in a game environment, it means that you can't generally
remember anything. So each time you have to move, perform an action, etc, its
completely independent of anything else you've done so far. I would say for
even the simplest games, this is a very inefficient way to go about learning
the game.</p>
<p>I would suggest looking into using q-learning instead. Most of the examples
you'll find are usually just simple games anyway (like learning to navigate a
map while avoiding walls, traps, monsters, etc). Reinforcement learning is a
type of online unsupervised learning that does really well in situations that
can be modeled as an agent interacting with an environment, like a game (or
robots). It does this trying to figure out what the optimal action is at each
state in the environment (where each state can include as many variables as
needed, much more than just 'where am i'). The trick then is maintain just
enough state that helps the bot make good decisions without having a distinct
point in your state 'space' for every possible combination of previous
actions.</p>
<p>To put that in more concrete terms, if you were to build a chess bot you would
probably have trouble if you tried to create a decision policy that made
decisions based on all previous moves since the set of all possible
combinations of chess moves grows really quickly. Even a simpler model of
where every piece is on the board is still a very large state space so you
have to find a way to simplify what you keep track of. But notice that you do
get to keep track of some state so that your bot doesn't just keep trying to
make a left term into a wall over and over again.</p>
<p>The wikipedia article is pretty jargon heavy but this tutorial does a much
better job translating the concepts into real world examples.</p>
<p>The one catch is that you do need to be able to define rewards to provide as
the positive 'reinforcement'. That is you need to be able to define the states
that the bot is trying to get to, otherwise it will just continue forever.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There is precedent: the monstrous rog-o-matic program succeeded in playing
rogue and even returned with the amulet of Yendor a few times. Unfortunately,
rogue was only released an a binary, not source, so it has died (unless you
can set up a 4.3BSD system on a MicroVAX), leaving rog-o-matic unable to play
any of the clones. It just hangs cos they're not close enough emulations.</p>
<p>However, rog-o-matic is, I think, my favourite program of all time, not only
because of what it achieved but because of the readability of the code and the
comprehensible intelligence of its algorithms. It used "genetic inheritance":
a new player would inherit a combination of preferences from a previous pair
of successful players, with some random offset, then be pitted against the
machine. More successful preferences would migrate up in the gene pool and
less successful ones down.</p>
<p>The source can be hard to find these days, but searching "rogomatic" will set
you on the path.</p>
