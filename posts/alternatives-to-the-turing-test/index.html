    <p>So we learned a bit about the Turing Test in my AI class. This got me thinking
about it. I can see a few limitations with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's limited to a certain context. What if I'm not designing an AI to converse with humans?</li>
<li>It favors acting humanly over acting rationally. For example, if I'm designing an AI to control nuclear missiles, do I <em>really</em> want it to act human? Granted, this is an extreme example, but you get the idea.</li>
<li>It could be influenced by factors that don't indicate that the computer can think humanly. For example, suppose I ask what 2334 * 321 is. I could tell if the device is a computer because it will probably answer me fairly quickly while a human would have to figure it out. The solution? Make the computer pause.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I'm sure that the Turing Test still has its place in determining machine
intelligence. But I see it as being fairly limited in scope. Are there any
alternatives? For that matter, am I wrong as to what I perceive to be its
limitations?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : Let me be clear: I'm not suggesting that the Turing Test should be
abandoned. I'm just curious if there are any other tests that overcome its
limitations (probably trading them for other limitations).</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Tell you what: before we answer your question, define "intelligence".</p>
<p>The Turing Test, as originally described, had some other problems too, the
most notable of them being that it's not "effective", which is to say there is
no way to tell when it's over.</p>
<p>Now, look at your (quite reasonable) objections: on one hand, if it gives the
right answer too quickly, it would make you suspicious; on the other, you're
not sure it would be good if it gives wrong answers, even if it would make you
think it might be "intelligent."</p>
<p>But, now, consider our interaction: you don't know that I'm <em>not</em> an
intelligent computer. How about, for a Star Trek reference, Mr Data on ST:TNG?
He's certainly distinguishable from a human and doesn't give human responses
at all times, but mostly passes.</p>
<p>Now, let's for a moment consider a person you meet who, instead of being
intelligent, is completely a mechanism: no "consciousness", no "soul." (This
kind of entity is called a "philosophical zombie" in the literature.) <em>Except</em>
for that missing "consciousness", this person, or simulacrum of a person, acts
like a person in all other ways: expresses pain on an injury, shows pleasure
when eating a good meal, shows affection to kittens <del>and small children</del>.
(Corrected because I want to pass this test myself.)</p>
<p>How could you tell that this philosophical zombie <em>wasn't</em> "intelligent" ?</p>
<p>The point here is that you've got good questions, but there aren't necessarily
well-accepted answers. My own opinion of the Turing Test is that it's a good
valid test, because the point of it, as Turing himself said, is that if you
can't tell the difference between an intelligent or sentient computer, and a
<em>really</em> intelligent entity, then you have to assume there is no difference.</p>
<p>Some other things you could read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read about John Searle's "Chinese Room"</li>
<li>Read Doug Hofstadter's "Gödel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I think you are missing the point of the Turing Test. It's not meant to be a
judge of the quality of an AI algorithm, but rather the success of an AI
algorithm meant to simulate human intelligence. In that sense it is really
more a test of the state of the art in AI rather than any particular AI
algorithm. That is, if we can design an AI algorithm to pass this test, then
we can say that we are able with AI to develop machines with human
intelligence.</p>
<p>It's reasonable to assume that there are other tests that would be equally
sufficient, but this test is elegant in its simplicity and relative lack of
constraints. There are basically no constraints on the inputs except their
format.</p>
