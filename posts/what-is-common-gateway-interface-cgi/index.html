what I did:</p>

<p>Edited the configuration file of Apache HTTPD to tell webserver to pass
all HTTP PUT requests to some <code>put.php</code> ( I had to write this PHP script)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement put.php to handle the request (save the file to the location

</li>
</ol>
<p>People said that I wrote a CGI Script. Seriously, I didn't have a clue what
they were talking about.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Did I really write CGI Script? </li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you understood what my confusion is. (Because I myself don't know where
I'm confused). I request you guys to keep your answer as simple as possible. I
really can't understand any fancy technical terminology. At least not in this
case.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>I found this amazing tutorial "CGI Programming Is Simple!" - CGI Tutorial,
which explains the concepts in <strong>simplest</strong> possible way. After reading this
article you may want to read Getting Started with CGI Programming in C to
supplement your understanding with actual code samples. I've also added these
links to this tutorial to Wikipedia's article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>CGI is an interface which tells the webserver how to pass data to and from an
application. More specifically, it describes how request information is passed
in environment variables (such as request type, remote IP address), how the
request body is passed in via standard input, and how the response is passed
out via standard output. You can refer to the CGI specification for details.</p>
<p>To use your image:</p>
<p><code>user (client) request for page ---&gt; webserver ---[CGI]----&gt; Server side
Program ---&gt; MySQL Server.</code></p>
<p>Most if not all, webservers can be configured to execute a program as a 'CGI'.
This means that the webserver, upon receiving a request, will forward the data
to a specific program, setting some environment variables and marshalling the
parameters via standard input and standard output so the program can know
where and what to look for.</p>
<p>The main benefit is that you can run ANY executable code from the web, given
that both the webserver and the program know how CGI works. That's why you
could write web programs in C or Bash with a regular CGI-enabled webserver.
That, and that most programming environments can easily use standard input,
standard output and environment variables.</p>
<p>In your case you most likely used another, specific for PHP, means of
communication between your scripts and the webserver, this, as you well
mention in your question, is an embedded interpreter called mod_php.</p>
<p>So, answering your questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What exactly is CGI?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whats the big deal with /cgi-bin/<em>.cgi? Whats up with this? I don't know
what is this cgi-bin directory on the server for. I don't know why they have
</em>.cgi extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the traditional place for cgi programs, many webservers come with this
directory pre configured to execute all binaries there as CGI programs. The
.cgi extension denotes an executable that is expected to work through the CGI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does Perl always comes in the way. CGI &amp; Perl (language). I also don't
know whats up with these two. Almost all the time I keep hearing these two
in combination "CGI &amp; Perl". This book is another great example CGI
Programming with Perl Why not "CGI Programming with PHP/JSP/ASP". I never
saw such things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Perl is ancient (older than PHP, JSP and ASP which all came to being
when CGI was already old, Perl existed when CGI was new) and became fairly
famous for being a very good language to serve dynamic webpages via the CGI.
Nowadays there are other alternatives to run Perl in a webserver, mainly
mod_perl.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CGI Programming in C this confuses me a lot. in C?? Seriously?? I don't know
what to say. I"m just confused. "in C"?? This changes everything. Program
needs to be compiled and executed. This entirely changes my view of web
programming. When do I compile? How does the program gets executed (because
it will be a machine code, so it must execute as a independent process). How
does it communicate with the web server? IPC? and interfacing with all the
servers (in my example MATLAB &amp; MySQL) using socket programming? I'm lost!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You compile the executable once, the webserver executes the program and passes
the data in the request to the program and outputs the received response. CGI
specifies that one program instance will be launched per each request. This is
why CGI is inefficient and kind of obsolete nowadays.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say that CGI is deprecated. Its no more in use. Is it so? What is its
latest update?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CGI is still used when performance is not paramount and a simple means of
executing code is required. It is inefficient for the previously stated
reasons and there are more modern means of executing any program in a web
enviroment. Currently the most famous is FastCGI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What exactly is CGI?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A means for a web server to get its data from a program (instead of, for
instance, a file).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whats the big deal with /cgi-bin/*.cgi?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No big deal. It is just a convention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know what is this cgi-bin directory on the server for. I don't know
why they have *.cgi extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The server has to know what to do with the file (i.e. treat it as a program to
execute instead of something to simply serve up). Having a .html extension
tells it to use a text/html content type. Having a .cgi extension tells it to
run it as a program.</p>
<p>Keeping executables in a separate directory gives some added protection
against executing incorrect files and/or serving up CGI programs as raw data
in case the server gets misconfigured.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does Perl always comes in the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't. Perl was just big and popular at the same time as CGI.</p>
<p>I haven't used Perl CGI for years. I was using mod_perl for a long time, and
tend towards PSGI/Plack with FastCGI these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is another great example CGI Programming with Perl Why not "CGI
Programming with PHP/JSP/ASP".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CGI isn't very efficient. Better methods for talking to programs from
webservers came along at around the same time as PHP. JSP and ASP <em>are</em>
different methods for talking to programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CGI Programming in C this confuses me a lot. in C?? Seriously??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a programming language, why not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When do I compile?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Write code</li>
<li>Compile</li>
<li>Access URL</li>
<li>Webserver runs program</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>How does the program gets executed (because it will be a machine code, so it
must execute as a independent process).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't have to execute as an independent process (you can write Apache
modules in C), but the whole concept of CGI is that it launches an external
process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does it communicate with the web server? IPC?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STDIN/STDOUT and environment variables — as defined in the CGI specification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and interfacing with all the servers (in my example MATLAB &amp; MySQL) using
socket programming?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using whatever methods you like and are supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say that CGI is depreciated. Its no more in use. Is it so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CGI is inefficient, slow and simple. It is rarely used, when it is used, it is
because it is simple. If performance isn't a big deal, then simplicity is
worth a lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is its latest update?</p>
</blockquote>
