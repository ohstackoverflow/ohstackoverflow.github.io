    <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>As of Java 8, static methods are now allowed in interfaces.</em></p>
<p>Here's the example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public interface IXMLizable&lt;T&gt;
{
  static T newInstanceFromXML(Element e);
  Element toXMLElement();
}
</pre></div>

<p>Of course this won't work. But why not?</p>
<p>One of the possible issues would be, what happens when you call:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">IXMLizable.newInstanceFromXML(e);
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, I think it should just call an empty method (i.e. {}). All
subclasses would be forced to implement the static method, so they'd all be
fine when calling the static method. So why isn't this possible?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I guess I'm looking for answer that's deeper than "because that's
the way Java is".</p>
<p>Is there a particular technological reason why static methods can't be
overwritten? That is, why did the designers of Java decide to make instance
methods overrideable but not static methods?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The problem with my design is I'm trying to use interfaces to
enforce a coding convention.</p>
<p>That is, the goal of the interface is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want the IXMLizable interface to allow me to convert classes that implement it to XML elements (using polymorphism, works fine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone wants to make a new instance of a class that implements the IXMLizable interface, they will always know that there will be a newInstanceFromXML(Element e) static constructor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is there any other way to ensure this, other than just putting a comment in
the interface?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2>Java 8 permits static interface methods</h2>
<p>With Java 8, interfaces <em>can</em> have static methods. They can also have concrete
instance methods, but not instance fields.</p>
<p>There are really two questions here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why, in the bad old days, couldn't interfaces contain static methods?</li>
<li>Why can't static methods be overridden?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Static methods in interfaces</h2>
<p>There was no strong technical reason why interfaces couldn't have had static
methods in previous versions. This is summed up nicely by the poster of a
duplicate question. Static interface methods were initially considered as a
small language change, and then there was an official proposal to add them in
Java 7, but it was later dropped due to unforeseen complications.</p>
<p>Finally, Java 8 introduced static interface methods, as well as override-able
instance methods with a default implementation. They still can't have instance
fields though. These features are part of the lambda expression support, and
you can read more about them in Part H of JSR 335.</p>
<h2>Overriding static methods</h2>
<p>The answer to the second question is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Static methods are resolvable at compile time. Dynamic dispatch makes sense
for instance methods, where the compiler can't determine the concrete type of
the object, and, thus, can't resolve the method to invoke. But invoking a
static method requires a class, and since that class is known <em>statically</em> —at
compile time—dynamic dispatch is unnecessary.</p>
<p>A little background on how instance methods work is necessary to understand
what's going on here. I'm sure the actual implementation is quite different,
but let me explain my notion of method dispatch, which models observed
behavior accurately.</p>
<p>Pretend that each class has a hash table that maps method signatures (name and
parameter types) to an actual chunk of code to implement the method. When the
virtual machine attempts to invoke a method on an instance, it queries the
object for its class and looks up the requested signature in the class's
table. If a method body is found, it is invoked. Otherwise, the parent class
of the class is obtained, and the lookup is repeated there. This proceeds
until the method is found, or there are no more parent classes—which results
in a <code>NoSuchMethodError</code>.</p>
<p>If a superclass and a subclass both have an entry in their tables for the same
method signature, the sub class's version is encountered first, and the
superclass's version is never used—this is an "override".</p>
<p>Now, suppose we skip the object instance and just start with a subclass. The
resolution could proceed as above, giving you a sort of "overridable" static
method. The resolution can all happen at compile-time, however, since the
compiler is starting from a known class, rather than waiting until runtime to
query an object of an unspecified type for its class. There is no point in
"overriding" a static method since one can always specify the class that
contains the desired version.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Constructor "interfaces"</h2>
<p>Here's a little more material to address the recent edit to the question.</p>
<p>It sounds like you want to effectively mandate a constructor-like method for
each implementation of <code>IXMLizable</code>. Forget about trying to enforce this with
an interface for a minute, and pretend that you have some classes that meet
this requirement. How would you use it?</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="n">implements</span> <span class="n">IXMLizable</span><span class="s">&lt;Foo&gt;</span> {
  <span class="n">public</span> <span class="n">static</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="n">newInstanceFromXML</span>(<span class="n">Element</span> <span class="nb">e</span>) { ... }
}

<span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="n">obj</span> = <span class="n">Foo</span>.<span class="n">newInstanceFromXML</span>(<span class="nb">e</span>);
</pre></div>

<p>Since you have to explicitly name the concrete type <code>Foo</code> when "constructing"
the new object, the compiler can verify that it does indeed have the necessary
factory method. And if it doesn't, so what? If I can implement an <code>IXMLizable</code>
that lacks the "constructor", and I create an instance and pass it to your
code, it <em>is</em> an <code>IXMLizable</code> with all the necessary interface.</p>
<p><em>Construction is part of the implementation,</em> not the interface. Any code that
works successfully with the interface doesn't care about the constructor. Any
code that cares about the constructor needs to know the concrete type anyway,
and the interface can be ignored.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>This was already asked and answered, here</p>
<p>To duplicate my answer:</p>
<p>There is never a point to declaring a static method in an interface. They
cannot be executed by the normal call MyInterface.staticMethod(). If you call
them by specifying the implementing class MyImplementor.staticMethod() then
you must know the actual class, so it is irrelevant whether the interface
contains it or not.</p>
<p>More importantly, static methods are never overridden, and if you try to do:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">MyInterface</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">MyImplementingClass</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">var</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">staticMethod</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>

<p>the rules for static say that the method defined in the declared type of var
must be executed. Since this is an interface, this is impossible.</p>
<p>The reason you can't execute "result=MyInterface.staticMethod()" is that it
would have to execute the version of the method defined in MyInterface. But
there can't be a version defined in MyInterface, because it's an interface. It
doesn't have code by definition.</p>
<p>While you can say that this amounts to "because Java does it that way", in
reality the decision is a logical consequence of other design decisions, also
made for very good reason.</p>
