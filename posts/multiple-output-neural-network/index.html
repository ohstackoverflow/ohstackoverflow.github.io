    <p>I have built my first neural network in python, and i've been playing around
with a few datasets; it's going well so far !</p>
<p>I have a quick question regarding modelling events with multiple outcomes: -</p>
<p>Say i wish to train a network to tell me the probability of each runner
winning a 100m sprint. I would give the network all of the relevant data
regarding each runner, and the number of outputs would be equal to the number
of runners in the race.</p>
<p>My question is, using a sigmoid function, how can i ensure the sum of the
outputs will be equal to 1.0 ? Will the network naturally learn to do this, or
will i have to somehow make this happen explicitly ? If so, how would i go
about doing this ?</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The output from your neural network will <em>approach</em> 1. I don't think it will
actually get to 1.</p>
<p>You actually don't need to see which output is equal to 1. Once you've trained
your network up to a specific error level, when you present the inputs, just
look for the maximum output in your output later. For example, let's say your
output layer presents the following output: <code>[0.0001, 0.00023, 0.0041,
0.99999412, 0.0012, 0.0002]</code>, then the runner that won the race is runner
number 4.</p>
<p>So yes, your network will "learn" to produce 1, but it won't exactly be 1.
This is why you train to within a certain error rate. I recently created a
neural network to recognize handwritten digits, and this is the method that I
used. In my output layer, I have a vector with 10 components. The first
component represents 0, and the last component represents 9. So when I present
a 4 to the network, I expect the output vector to look like <code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. Of course, it's not what I get exactly, but it's what I train
the network to provide. So to find which digit it is, I simply check to see
which component has the highest output or score.</p>
<p>Now in your second question, I believe you're asking <em>how</em> the network would
learn to provide the correct answer? To do this, you need to provide your
network with some training data and train it until the output is under a
certain error threshold. So what you need is a set of data that contains the
inputs <em>and</em> the correct output. Initially your neural network will be set up
with random weights (there are some algorithms that help you select <em>better</em>
weights to minimize training time, but that's a little more advanced). Next
you need a way to tell the neural network to <em>learn</em> from the data provided.
So basically you give the data to the neural network and it provides an
output, which is highly likely to be wrong. Then you compare that data with
the expected (correct) output and you tell the neural network to update its
weights so that it gets closer to the correct answer. You do this over and
over again until the error is below a certain threshold.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to implement the stochastic backpropagation
algorithm. In this algorithm, you calculate the error between the actual
output of the neural network and the expected output. Then you backpropagate
the error from the output layer all the way up to the weights to the hidden
layer, adjusting the weights as you go. Then you repeat this process until the
error that you calculate is below a certain threshold. So during each step,
you're getting closer and closer towards your solution.</p>
<p>You can use the algorithm described here. There is a decent amount of math
involved, so be prepared for that! If you want to see an example of an
implementation of this algorithm, you can take a look at this Java code that I
have on github. The code uses momentum and a simple form of simulated
annealing as well, but the standard backpropagation algorithm should be easily
discernible. The Wikipedia article on backpropagation has a link to an
implementation of the backpropagation algorithm in Python.</p>
<p>You're probably not going to understand the algorithm immediately; expect to
spend some time understanding it and working through some of the math. I sat
down with a pencil and paper as I was coding, and that's how I eventually
understood what was going on.</p>
<p>Here are a few resources that should help you understand backpropagation a
little better:</p>
<ul>
<li>The learning process: backpropagation</li>
<li>Error backpropagation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want some more resources, you can also take a look at my answer here.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Basically you want a function of multiple real numbers that converts those
real numbers into probabilities (each between 0 to 1, sum to 1). You can this
easily by post processing the output of your network.</p>
<p>Your network gives you real numbers r1, r2, ..., rn that increases as the
probability of each runner wins the race.</p>
<p>Then compute exp(r1), exp(r2), ..., and sum them up for ers = exp(r1) +
exp(r2) + ... + exp(rn). Then the probability that the first racer wins is
exp(r1) / ers.</p>
<p>This is a one use of the Boltzman distribution.
