    <p>I have a computer with 1 MB of RAM and no other local storage. I must use it
to accept 1 million 8-digit decimal numbers over a TCP connection, sort them,
and then send the sorted list out over another TCP connection.</p>
<p>The list of numbers may contain duplicates, which I must not discard. The code
will be placed in ROM, so I need not subtract the size of my code from the 1
MB. I already have code to drive the Ethernet port and handle TCP/IP
connections, and it requires 2 KB for its state data, including a 1 KB buffer
via which the code will read and write data. Is there a solution to this
problem?</p>
<p><strong>Sources Of Question And Answer:</strong></p>
<p>slashdot.org</p>
<p>cleaton.net</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A solution is possible only because of the difference between 1 megabyte and 1
million bytes. There are about 2 to the power 8093729.5 different ways to
choose 1 million 8-digit numbers with duplicates allowed and order
unimportant, so a machine with only 1 million bytes of RAM doesn't have enough
states to represent all the possibilities. But 1M (less 2k for TCP/IP) is
1022<em>1024</em>8 = 8372224 bits, so a solution is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1, initial solution</strong></p>
<p>This approach needs a little more than 1M, I'll refine it to fit into 1M
later.</p>
<p>I'll store a compact sorted list of numbers in the range 0 to 99999999 as a
sequence of sublists of 7-bit numbers. The first sublist holds numbers from 0
to 127, the second sublist holds numbers from 128 to 255, etc. 100000000/128
is exactly 781250, so 781250 such sublists will be needed.</p>
<p>Each sublist consists of a 2-bit sublist header followed by a sublist body.
The sublist body takes up 7 bits per sublist entry. The sublists are all
concatenated together, and the format makes it possible to tell where one
sublist ends and the next begins. The total storage required for a fully
populated list is 2<em>781250 + 7</em>1000000 = 8562500 bits, which is about 1.021
M-bytes.</p>
<p>The 4 possible sublist header values are:</p>
<p><strong>00</strong> Empty sublist, nothing follows.</p>
<p><strong>01</strong> Singleton, there is only one entry in the sublist and and next 7 bits
hold it.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> The sublist holds at least 2 distinct numbers. The entries are stored
in non-decreasing order, except that the last entry is less than or equal to
the first. This allows the end of the sublist to be identified. For example,
the numbers 2,4,6 would be stored as (4,6,2). The numbers 2,2,3,4,4 would be
stored as (2,3,4,4,2).</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> The sublist holds 2 or more repetitions of a single number. The next 7
bits give the number. Then come zero or more 7-bit entries with the value 1,
followed by a 7-bit entry with the value 0. The length of the sublist body
dictates the number of repetitions. For example, the numbers 12,12 would be
stored as (12,0), the numbers 12,12,12 would be stored as (12,1,0),
12,12,12,12 would be (12,1,1,0) and so on.</p>
<p>I start off with an empty list, read a bunch of numbers in and store them as
32 bit integers, sort the new numbers in place (using heapsort, probably) and
then merge them into a new compact sorted list. Repeat until there are no more
numbers to read, then walk the compact list once more to generate the output.</p>
<p>The line below represents memory just before the start of the list merge
operation. The "O"s are the region that hold the sorted 32-bit integers. The
"X"s are the region that hold the old compact list. The "=" signs are the
expansion room for the compact list, 7 bits for each integer in the "O"s. The
"Z"s are other random overhead.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO==========XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</pre></div>

<p>The merge routine starts reading at the leftmost "O" and at the leftmost "X",
and starts writing at the leftmost "=". The write pointer doesn't catch the
compact list read pointer until all of the new integers are merged, because
both pointers advance 2 bits for each sublist and 7 bits for each entry in the
old compact list, and there is enough extra room for the 7-bit entries for the
new numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2, cramming it into 1M</strong></p>
<p>To Squeeze the solution above into 1M, I need to make the compact list format
a bit more compact. I'll get rid of one of the sublist types, so that there
will be just 3 different possible sublist header values. Then I can use "00",
"01" and "1" as the sublist header values and save a few bits. The sublist
types are:</p>
<p>A Empty sublist, nothing follows.</p>
<p>B Singleton, there is only one entry in the sublist and and next 7 bits hold
it.</p>
<p>C The sublist holds at least 2 distinct numbers. The entries are stored in
non-decreasing order, except that the last entry is less than or equal to the
first. This allows the end of the sublist to be identified. For example, the
numbers 2,4,6 would be stored as (4,6,2). The numbers 2,2,3,4,4 would be
stored as (2,3,4,4,2).</p>
<p>D The sublist consists of 2 or more repetitions of a single number.</p>
<p>My 3 sublist header values will be "A", "B" and "C", so I need a way to
represent D-type sublists.</p>
<p>Suppose I have the C-type sublist header followed by 3 entries, such as
"C[17][101][58]". This can't be part of a valid C-type sublist as described
above, since the third entry is less than the second but more than the first.
I can use this type of construct to represent a D-type sublist. In bit terms,
anywhere I have "C{00?????}{1??????}{01?????}" is an impossible C-type
sublist. I'll use this to represent a sublist consisting of 3 or more
repetitions of a single number. The first two 7-bit words encode the number
(the "N" bits below) and are followed by zero or more {0100001} words followed
by a {0100000} word.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">For</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">example</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">repetitions</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"C{00NNNNN}{1NN0000}{0100000}"</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">repetitions</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"C{00NNNNN}{1NN0000}{0100001}{0100000}"</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">so</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">on</span>.
</pre></div>

<p>That just leaves lists that hold exactly 2 repetitions of a single number.
I'll represent those with another impossible C-type sublist pattern:
"C{0??????}{11?????}{10?????}". There's plenty of room for the 7 bits of the
number in the first 2 words, but this pattern is longer than the sublist that
it represents, which makes things a bit more complex. The five question-marks
at the end can be considered not part of the pattern, so I have:
"C{0NNNNNN}{11N????}10" as my pattern, with the number to be repeated stored
in the "N"s. That's 2 bits too long.</p>
<p>I'll have to borrow 2 bits and pay them back from the 4 unused bits in this
pattern. When reading, on encountering "C{0NNNNNN}{11N00AB}10", output 2
instances of the number in the "N"s, overwrite the "10" at the end with bits A
and B, and rewind the read pointer by 2 bits. Destructive reads are ok for
this algorithm, since each compact list gets walked only once.</p>
<p>When writing a sublist of 2 repetitions of a single number, write
"C{0NNNNNN}11N00" and set the borrowed bits counter to 2. At every write where
the borrowed bits counter is non-zero, it is decremented for each bit written
and "10" is written when the counter hits zero. So the next 2 bits written
will go into slots A and B, and then the "10" will get dropped onto the end.</p>
<p>With 3 sublist header values represented by "00", "01" and "1", I can assign
"1" to the most popular sublist type. I'll need a small table to map sublist
header values to sublist types, and I'll need an occurrence counter for each
sublist type so that I know what the best sublist header mapping is.</p>
<p>The worst case minimal representation of a fully populated compact list occurs
when all the sublist types are equally popular. In that case I save 1 bit for
every 3 sublist headers, so the list size is 2<em>781250 + 7</em>1000000 - 781250/3 =
8302083.3 bits. Rounding up to a 32 bit word boundary, thats 8302112 bits, or
1037764 bytes.</p>
<p>1M minus the 2k for TCP/IP state and buffers is 1022*1024 = 1046528 bytes,
leaving me 8764 bytes to play with.</p>
<p>But what about the process of changing the sublist header mapping ? In the
memory map below, "Z" is random overhead, "=" is free space, "X" is the
compact list.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=====XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</pre></div>

<p>Start reading at the leftmost "X" and start writing at the leftmost "=" and
work right. When it's done the compact list will be a little shorter and it
will be at the wrong end of memory:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=======
</pre></div>

<p>So then I'll need to shunt it to the right:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=======XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</pre></div>

<p>In the header mapping change process, up to 1/3 of the sublist headers will be
changing from 1-bit to 2-bit. In the worst case these will all be at the head
of the list, so I'll need at least 781250/3 bits of free storage before I
start, which takes me back to the memory requirements of the previous version
of the compact list :(</p>
<p>To get around that, I'll split the 781250 sublists into 10 sublist groups of
78125 sublists each. Each group has its own independent sublist header
mapping. Using the letters A to J for the groups:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=====AAAAAABBCCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
</pre></div>

<p>Each sublist group shrinks or stays the same during a sublist header mapping
change:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ZZZ=====AAAAAABBCCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAA=====BBCCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABB=====CCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCC======DDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDD======EEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEE======FFFGGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFF======GGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGG=======HHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHH=======IJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHI=======JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
ZZZAAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ=======
ZZZ=======AAAAAABBCCCDDDDDEEEFFFGGGGGGGGGGHHIJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
</pre></div>

<p>The worst case temporary expansion of a sublist group during a mapping change
is 78125/3 = 26042 bits, under 4k. If I allow 4k plus the 1037764 bytes for a
fully populated compact list, that leaves me 8764 - 4096 = 4668 bytes for the
"Z"s in the memory map.</p>
<p>That should be plenty for the 10 sublist header mapping tables, 30 sublist
header occurrence counts and the other few counters, pointers and small
buffers I'll need, and space I've used without noticing, like stack space for
function call return addresses and local variables.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3, how long would it take to run?</strong></p>
<p>With an empty compact list the 1-bit list header will be used for an empty
sublist, and the starting size of the list will be 781250 bits. In the worst
case the list grows 8 bits for each number added, so 32 + 8 = 40 bits of free
space are needed for each of the 32-bit numbers to be placed at the top of the
list buffer and then sorted and merged. In the worst case, changing the
sublist header mapping results in a space usage of 2<em>781250 + 7</em>entries -
781250/3 bits.</p>
<p>With a policy of changing the sublist header mapping after every fifth merge
once there are at least 800000 numbers in the list, a worst case run would
involve a total of about 30M of compact list reading and writing activity.</p>

<p><strong>Editor:</strong> There is no proof of the maximum memory requirements offered by
the author either in this post or in his blogs. Since the number of bits
necessary to encode a value depends on the values previously encoded, such a
proof is likely non-trivial. The author notes that the largest encoded size he
could stumble upon empirically was <code>1011732</code>, and chose the buffer size
<code>1013000</code> arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Together, these two arrays take 1045000 bytes of storage. That leaves 1048576
- 1045000 - 2×1024 = 1528 bytes for remaining variables and stack space.</p>
