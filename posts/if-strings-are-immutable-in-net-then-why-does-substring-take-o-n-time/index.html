    <p>Given that strings are immutable in .NET, I'm wondering why they have been
designed such that <code>string.Substring()</code> takes O(<code>substring.Length</code>) time,
instead of <code>O(1)</code>?</p>
<p>i.e. what were the tradeoffs, if any?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>UPDATE: I liked this question so much, I just blogged it. See Strings,
immutability and persistence</p>
<hr>
<p>The short answer is: <strong>O(n) is O(1) if n does not grow large.</strong> Most people
extract tiny substrings from tiny strings, so how the complexity grows
asymptotically is <em>completely irrelevant</em>.</p>
<p>The long answer is:</p>
<p>An immutable data structure built such that operations on an instance permit
re-use of the memory of the original with only a small amount (typically O(1)
or O(lg n)) of copying or new allocation is called a "persistent" immutable
data structure. Strings in .NET are immutable; your question is essentially
"why are they not persistent"?</p>
<p>Because when you look at operations that are <em>typically</em> done on strings in
.NET programs, it is in every relevant way <em>hardly worse at all</em> to simply
make an entirely new string. <strong>The expense and difficulty of building a
complex persistent data structure doesn't pay for itself.</strong></p>
<p>People typically use "substring" to extract a short string -- say, ten or
twenty characters -- out of a somewhat longer string -- maybe a couple hundred
characters. You have a line of text in a comma-separated file and you want to
extract the third field, which is a last name. The line will be maybe a couple
hundred characters long, the name will be a couple dozen. String allocation
and memory copying of fifty bytes is <em>astonishingly fast</em> on modern hardware.
That making a new data structure that consists of a pointer to the middle of
an existing string plus a length is <em>also</em> astonishingly fast is irrelevant;
"fast enough" is by definition fast enough.</p>
<p>The substrings extracted are typically small in size and short in lifetime;
the garbage collector is going to reclaim them soon, and they didn't take up
much room on the heap in the first place. So using a persistent strategy that
encourages reuse of most of the memory is also not a win; all you've done is
made your garbage collector get slower because now it has to worry about
handling interior pointers.</p>
<p>If the substring operations people typically did on strings were completely
different, then it would make sense to go with a persistent approach. If
people typically had million-character strings, and were extracting thousands
of overlapping substrings with sizes in the hundred-thousand-character range,
and those substrings lived a long time on the heap, then it would make perfect
sense to go with a persistent substring approach; it would be wasteful and
foolish not to. But <strong>most line-of-business programmers do not do anything
even vaguely like those sorts of things</strong>. .NET is not a platform that is
tailored for the needs of the Human Genome Project; DNA analysis programmers
have to solve problems with those string usage characteristics every day; odds
are good that you do not. The few who do build their own persistent data
structures that closely match <em>their</em> usage scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, my team writes programs that do on-the-fly analysis of C# and VB
code as you type it. Some of those code files are <em>enormous</em> and thus we
cannot be doing O(n) string manipulation to extract substrings or insert or
delete characters. We have built a bunch of persistent immutable data
structures for representing edits to a text buffer that permit us to quickly
and efficiently re-use the bulk of the existing string data <em>and</em> the existing
lexical and syntactic analyses upon a typical edit. This was a hard problem to
solve and its solution was narrowly tailored to the specific domain of C# and
VB code editing. It would be unrealistic to expect the built-in string type to
solve this problem for us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Precisely <em>because</em> Strings are immutable, <code>.Substring</code> must make a copy of at
least a portion of the original string. Making a copy of <em>n</em> bytes should take
O(n) time.</p>
<p>How do you think you would copy a bunch of bytes in <em>constant</em> time?</p>
<hr>
<p>EDIT: Mehrdad suggests not copying the string at all, but keeping a reference
to a piece of it.</p>
<p>Consider in .Net, a multi-megabyte string, on which someone calls
<code>.SubString(n, n+3)</code> (for any n in the middle of the string).</p>
<p>Now, the ENTIRE string cannot be Garbage Collected just because one reference
is holding on to 4 characters? That seems like a ridiculous waste of space.</p>
<p>Further, tracking references to substrings (which may even be inside
substrings), and trying to copy at optimal times to avoid defeating the GC (as
described above), makes the concept a nightmare. It is far simpler, and more
reliable, to copy on <code>.SubString</code>, and maintain the straightforward immutable
model.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's a <strong>good little read</strong> about the danger of keeping references
to substrings within larger strings.</p>
