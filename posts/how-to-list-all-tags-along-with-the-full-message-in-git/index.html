Something like this is close:

    <p>I want git to list all tags along with the full annotation or commit message.
Something like this is close:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git tag -n5
</pre></div>

<p>This does exactly what I want except that it will only show up to the first 5
lines of the tag message.</p>
<p>I guess I can just use a very large number. What is the highest number I can
use here? Is it the same on every computer?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> : I have had much time to think about this, and now I think I don't
necessarily want to show the entirety of each message if some of them are
extraordinarily long. I didn't really have any particular need that required
me to see massive messages (other than my own propensity to be long winded in
everything I write, including tag messages). I just didn't like the idea that
it was not necessarily going to show me the whole message, as that made me
feel like it was hiding information from me. But too much information can also
be a bad thing.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git tag -n99
</pre></div>

<p>Short and sweet. This will list up to 99 lines from each tag annotation/commit
message. Here is a link to the official documentation for git tag.</p>
<p>I now think the limitation of only showing up to 99 lines per tag is actually
a good thing as most of the time, if there were really more than 99 lines for
a single tag, you wouldn't really want to see all the rest of the lines would
you? If you did want to see more than 99 lines per tag, you could always
increase this to a larger number.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess there could be a specific situation or reason to want to see
massive tag messages, but at what point do you <strong>not</strong> want to see the whole
message? When it has more than 999 lines? 10,000? 1,000,000? My point is, it
typically makes sense to have a cap on how many lines you would see, and this
number allows you to set that.</p>
<p>Since I am making an argument for what you generally want to see when looking
at your tags, it probably makes sense to set something like this as an alias
(from Iulian Onofrei's comment below):</p>
<p><code>git config --global alias.tags 'tag -n99'</code></p>
<p>I mean, you don't really want to have to type in <code>git tag -n99</code> every time you
just want to see your tags do you? Once that alias is configured, whenever you
want to see your tags, you would just type <code>git tags</code> into your terminal.
Personally, I prefer to take things a step further than this and create even
more abbreviated bash aliases for all my commonly used commands. For that
purpose, you could add something like this to your .bashrc file (works on
Linux and similar environments):</p>
<p><code>alias gtag='git tag -n99'</code></p>
<p>Then whenever you want to see your tags, you just type <code>gtag</code>. Another
advantage of going down the alias path (either git aliases or bash aliases or
whatever) is you now have a spot already in place where you can add further
customizations to how you personally, generally want to have your tags shown
to you (like sorting them in certain ways as in my comment below, etc). Once
you get over the hurtle of creating your first alias, you will now realize how
easy it is to create more of them for other things you like to work in a
customized way, like <code>git log</code>, but let's save that one for a different
question/answer.</p>
