    <p>I'm designing a realtime strategy wargame where the AI will be responsible for
controlling a large number of units (possibly 1000+) on a large hexagonal map.</p>
<p>A unit has a number of action points which can be expended on movement,
attacking enemy units or various special actions (e.g. building new units).
For example, a tank with 5 action points could spend 3 on movement then 2 in
firing on an enemy within range. Different units have different costs for
different actions etc.</p>
<p>Some additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output of the AI is a "command" to any given unit</li>
<li>Action points are allocated at the beginning of a time period, but may be spent at any point within the time period (this is to allow for realtime multiplayer games). Hence "do nothing and save action points for later" is a potentially valid tactic (e.g. a gun turret that cannot move waiting for an enemy to come within firing range)</li>
<li>The game is updating in realtime, but the AI can get a consistent snapshot of the game state at any time (thanks to the game state being one of Clojure's persistent data structures)</li>
<li>I'm not expecting "optimal" behaviour, just something that is not obviously stupid and provides reasonable fun/challenge to play against</li>
</ul>
<p>What can you recommend in terms of specific algorithms/approaches that would
allow for the right balance between efficiency and reasonably intelligent
behaviour?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>First you should aim to make your game turn based at some level for the AI
(i.e. you can somehow model it turn based even if it may not be entirely turn
based, in RTS you may be able to break discrete intervals of time into turns.)
Second, you should determine how much information the AI should work with.
That is, if the AI is allowed to cheat and know every move of its opponent
(thereby making it stronger) or if it should know less or more. Third, you
should define a cost function of a state. The idea being that a higher cost
means a worse state for the computer to be in. Fourth you need a move
generator, generating all valid states the AI can transition to from a given
state (this may be homogeneous [state-independent] or heterogeneous [state-
dependent].)</p>
<p>The thing is, the cost function will be greatly influenced by what exactly you
define the state to be. The more information you encode in the state the
better balanced your AI will be but the more difficult it will be for it to
perform, as it will have to search exponentially more for every additional
state variable you include (in an exhaustive search.)</p>
<p>If you provide a definition of a state and a cost function your problem
transforms to a general problem in AI that can be tackled with any algorithm
of your choice.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of what I think would work well:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evolutionary algorithms may work well if you put enough effort into them, but they will add a layer of complexity that will create room for bugs amongst other things that can go wrong. They will also require extreme amounts of tweaking of the fitness function etc. I don't have much experience working with these but if they are anything like neural networks (which I believe they are since both are heuristics inspired by biological models) you will quickly find they are fickle and far from consistent. Most importantly, I doubt they add any benefits over the option I describe in 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the cost function and state defined it would technically be possible for you to apply gradient decent (with the assumption that the state function is differentiable and the domain of the state variables are continuous) however this would probably yield inferior results, since the biggest weakness of gradient descent is getting stuck in local minima. To give an example, this method would be prone to something like attacking the enemy always as soon as possible because there is a non-zero chance of annihilating them. Clearly, this may not be desirable behaviour for a game, however, gradient decent is a greedy method and doesn't know better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This option would be my most highest recommended one: simulated annealing. Simulated annealing would (IMHO) have all the benefits of 1. without the added complexity while being much more robust than 2. In essence SA is just a random walk amongst the states. So in addition to the cost and states you will have to define a way to randomly transition between states. SA is also not prone to be stuck in local minima, while producing very good results quite consistently. The only tweaking required with SA would be the cooling schedule--which decides how fast SA will converge. The greatest advantage of SA I find is that it is conceptually simple and produces superior results empirically to most other methods I have tried. Information on SA can be found here with a long list of generic implementations at the bottom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3b. ( <em>Edit Added much later</em> ) SA and the techniques I listed above are
general AI techniques and not really specialized to AI for games. In general,
the more specialized the algorithm the more chance it has at performing
better. See No Free Lunch Theorem 2. Another extension of 3 is something
called parallel tempering which dramatically improves the performance of SA by
helping it avoid local optima. Some of the original papers on parallel
tempering are quite dated 3, but others have been updated4.</p>
<p>Regardless of what method you choose in the end, its going to be very
important to break your problem down into states and a cost function as I said
earlier. As a rule of thumb I would start with 20-50 state variables as your
state search space is exponential in the number of these variables.</p>
