    <h3>The Situation</h3>
<p>I’m trying to port an open-source library to Python 3. (SymPy, if anyone is
wondering.)</p>
<p>So, I need to run <code>2to3</code> automatically when building for Python 3. To do that,
I need to use <code>distribute</code>. Therefore, I need to port the current system,
which (according to the doctest) is <code>distutils</code>.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m not sure what’s the difference between these
modules—<code>distutils</code>, <code>distribute</code>, <code>setuptools</code>. The documentation is sketchy
as best, as they all seem to be a fork of one another, intended to be
compatible in most circumstances (but actually, not all)…and so on, and so
forth.</p>
<h3>The Question</h3>
<p><strong>Could someone explain the differences?</strong> What am I supposed to use? What is
the most modern solution? (As an aside, I’d also appreciate some guide on
porting to <code>Distribute</code>, but that’s a tad beyond the scope of the question…)</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>As of May 2022, most of the other answers to this question are several years
out-of-date. When you come across advice on Python packaging issues, remember
to look at the date of publication, and don't trust out-of-date information.</p>
<p>The Python Packaging User Guide is worth a read. Every page has a "last
updated" date displayed, so you can check the recency of the manual, and it's
quite comprehensive. The fact that it's hosted on a subdomain of python.org of
the Python Software Foundation just adds credence to it. The Project Summaries
page is especially relevant here.</p>
<h3>Summary of tools:</h3>
<p>Here's a summary of the Python packaging landscape:</p>
<h4>Supported tools:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>setuptools</code></strong> was developed to overcome Distutils' limitations, and is not included in the standard library. It introduced a command-line utility called <code>easy_install</code>. It also introduced the <code>setuptools</code> Python package that can be imported in your <code>setup.py</code> script, and the <code>pkg_resources</code> Python package that can be imported in your code to locate data files installed with a distribution. One of its gotchas is that it monkey-patches the <code>distutils</code> Python package. It should work well with <code>pip</code>. It sees regular releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Official docs | Pypi page | GitHub repo | <code>setuptools</code> section of Python Package User Guide</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>scikit-build</code></strong> is an improved build system generator that internally uses CMake to build compiled Python extensions. Because scikit-build isn't based on distutils, it doesn't really have any of its limitations. When ninja-build is present, scikit-build can compile large projects over three times faster than the alternatives. It should work well with <code>pip</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Official docs | Pypi page | GitHub repo | <code>scikit-build</code> section of Python Package User Guide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>distlib</code></strong> is a library that provides functionality that is used by higher level tools like <code>pip</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Official Docs | Pypi page | Bitbucket repo | <code>distlib</code> section of Python Package User Guide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>packaging</code></strong> is also a library that provides functionality used by higher level tools like <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Official Docs | Pypi page | GitHub repo | <code>packaging</code> section of Python Package User Guide</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deprecated/abandoned tools:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>distutils</code></strong> is still included in the standard library of Python, but is considered deprecated as of Python 3.10. It is useful for simple Python distributions, but lacks features. It introduces the <code>distutils</code> Python package that can be imported in your <code>setup.py</code> script.</p>
<ul>
<li>Official docs | <code>distutils</code> section of Python Package User Guide</li>
<li>
<strong><code>distribute</code></strong> was a fork of <code>setuptools</code>. It shared the same namespace, so if you had Distribute installed, <code>import setuptools</code> would actually import the package distributed with Distribute. <em><strong>Distribute was merged back into Setuptools 0.7</strong></em> , so you don't need to use Distribute any more. In fact, the version on Pypi is just a compatibility layer that installs Setuptools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>distutils2</code></strong> was an attempt to take the best of <code>distutils</code>, <code>setuptools</code> and <code>distribute</code> and become the standard tool included in Python's standard library. The idea was that <code>distutils2</code> would be distributed for old Python versions, and that <code>distutils2</code> would be renamed to <code>packaging</code> for Python 3.3, which would include it in its standard library. These plans did not go as intended, however, and currently, <em><strong><code>distutils2</code> is an abandoned project</strong></em>. The latest release was in March 2012, and its Pypi home page has finally been updated to reflect its death.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Others:</h3>
<p>There are other tools, if you are interested, read Project Summaries in the
Python Packaging User Guide. I won't list them all, to not repeat that page,
and to keep the answer matching the question, which was only about
<code>distribute</code>, <code>distutils</code>, <code>setuptools</code> and <code>distutils2</code>.</p>
<h3>Recommendation:</h3>
<p>If all of this is new to you, and you don't know where to start, <strong>I would
recommend learning<code>setuptools</code></strong>, along with <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code>, which all
work very well together.</p>
<p>If you're looking into <code>virtualenv</code>, you might be interested in this question:
What is the difference between <code>venv</code>, <code>pyvenv</code>, <code>pyenv</code>, <code>virtualenv</code>,
<code>virtualenvwrapper</code>, etc?. (Yes, I know, I groan with you.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I’m a distutils maintainer and distutils2/packaging contributor. I did a talk
about Python packaging at ConFoo 2011 and these days I’m writing an extended
version of it. It’s not published yet, so here are excerpts that should help
define things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distutils</strong> is the standard tool used for packaging. It works rather well for simple needs, but is limited and not trivial to extend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setuptools</strong> is a project born from the desire to fill missing distutils functionality and explore new directions. In some subcommunities, it’s a <em>de facto</em> standard. It uses monkey-patching and magic that is frowned upon by Python core developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribute</strong> is a fork of Setuptools that was started by developers feeling that its development pace was too slow and that it was not possible to evolve it. Its development was considerably slowed when distutils2 was started by the same group. 2013-August update: distribute is merged back into setuptools and discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distutils2</strong> is a new distutils library, started as a fork of the distutils codebase, with good ideas taken from setup tools (of which some were thoroughly discussed in PEPs), and a basic installer inspired by pip. <del>The actual name you use to import Distutils2 is<code>packaging</code> in the Python 3.3+ standard library, or <code>distutils2</code> in 2.4+ and 3.1–3.2. (A backport will be available soon.)</del> Distutils2 did not make the Python 3.3 release, and it was put on hold.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More info:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fate of Distutils – Pycon Summit + Packaging Sprint detailed report</li>
<li>A Quick Diff between Distutils and Distutils2</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to finish my guide soon, it will contain more info about each library’s
strong and weak points and a transition guide.</p>
