    <p>I am trying to understand how the whole ecosystem of <code>iOS</code> works.<br>
Until now, I could find an answer for most of my question (and trust me, there
have been a lots of them), but for this one, there seems to be no clear answer
yet.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between XcodeProject and XcodeWorkspace files?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the difference between the two of them?</li>
<li>What are they responsible for?</li>
<li>Which one of them should I work with when I'm developing my Apps in team/alone?</li>
<li>Is there anything else I should be aware of in matter of these two files?</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I think there are three key items you need to understand regarding project
structure: <em>Targets</em> , <em>projects</em> , and <em>workspaces</em>. <strong>Targets</strong> specify in
detail how a product/binary (i.e., an application or library) is built. They
include build settings, such as compiler and linker flags, and they define
which files (source code and resources) actually belong to a product. When you
build/run, you always select one specific target.</p>
<p>It is likely that you have a few targets that share code and resources. These
different targets can be slightly different versions of an app (iPad/iPhone,
different brandings,…) or test cases that naturally need to access the same
source files as the app. All these related targets can be grouped in a
<strong>project</strong>. While the project contains the files from all its targets, each
target picks its own subset of relevant files. The same goes for build
settings: You can define default project-wide settings in the project, but if
one of your targets needs different settings, you can always override them
there:</p>
<p><img alt="Shared project settings that all targets inherit, unless they overwrite
it" src="../../images/WToPC.png"></p>
<p>Shared project settings that all targets inherit, unless they override it</p>
<p><img alt="Concrete target settings: PSE iPhone overwrites the project’s Base SDK
setting" src="../../images/UA3TA.png"></p>
<p>Concrete target settings: <em>PSE iPhone</em> overrides the project’s <code>Base SDK</code>
setting</p>
<p>In Xcode, you always open projects (or workspaces, but not targets), and all
the targets it contains can be built/run, but there’s no way/definition of
building a project, so every project needs at least one target in order to be
more than just a collection of files and settings.</p>
<p><img alt="Select one of the project’s targets to run" src="../../images/guLvo.png"></p>
<p>Select one of the project’s targets to run</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, projects are all you need. If you have a dependency that
you build from source, you can embed it as a <strong>subproject</strong>. Subprojects can
be opened separately or within their super project.</p>
<p><img alt="demoLib is a subprojec" src="../../images/g3mpl.png"></p>
<p><em>demoLib</em> is a subproject</p>
<p>If you add one of the subproject’s targets to the super project’s
dependencies, the subproject will be automatically built unless it has
remained unchanged. The advantage here is that you can edit files from both
your project and your dependencies in the same Xcode window, and when you
build/run, you can select from the project’s and its subprojects’ targets:</p>
<p><img alt="Running targets from a subproject" src="../../images/sV41Z.png"></p>
<p>If, however, your library (the subproject) is used by a variety of other
projects (or their targets, to be precise), it makes sense to put it on the
same hierarchy level – that’s what <strong>workspaces</strong> are for. Workspaces contain
and manage projects, and all the projects it includes directly (i.e., not
their subprojects) are on the same level and their targets can depend on each
other (projects’ targets can depend on subprojects’ targets, but not vice
versa).</p>
<p><img alt="Workspace structure" src="../../images/1ug5Z.png"></p>
<p>Workspace structure</p>
<p>In this example, both apps ( <em>AnotherApplication</em> / <em>ProjectStructureExample</em>
) can reference the <em>demoLib</em> project’s targets. This would also be possible
by including the <em>demoLib</em> project in both other projects as a subproject
(which is a reference only, so no duplication necessary), but if you have lots
of cross-dependencies, workspaces make more sense. If you open a workspace,
you can choose from all projects’ targets when building/running.</p>
<p><img alt="Running targets from a workspace" src="../../images/LtHRd.png"></p>
<p>You can still open your project files separately, but it is likely their
targets won’t build because Xcode cannot resolve the dependencies unless you
open the workspace file. Workspaces give you the same benefit as subprojects:
Once a dependency changes, Xcode will rebuild it to make sure it’s up-to-date
(although I have had some issues with that, it doesn’t seem to work reliably).</p>
<p><strong>Your questions in a nutshell</strong> :</p>
<p>1) Projects contain files (code/resouces), settings, and targets that build
products from those files and settings. Workspaces contain projects which can
reference each other.</p>
<p>2) Both are responsible for structuring your overall project, but on different
levels.</p>
<p>3) I think projects are sufficient in most cases. Don’t use workspaces unless
there’s a specific reason. Plus, you can always embed your project in a
workspace later.</p>
<p>4) I think that’s what the above text is for…</p>
<p>There’s one remark for 3): CocoaPods, which automatically handles 3rd party
libraries for you, uses workspaces. Therefore, you have to use them, too, when
you use <code>CocoaPods</code> (which a lot of people do).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>A workspace is a collection of projects. It's useful to organize your projects
when there's correlation between them (e.g.: Project A includes a library,
that is provided as a project itself as project B. When you build the
workspace project B is compiled and linked in project A).<br>
It's common to use a workspace in the popular CocoaPods. When you install your
pods, they are placed inside a workspace, that holds your project and the pod
libraries.</p>
