    <p>I am looking for a way to wrap APIs around default functions in my PHP-based
web applications, databases and CMSs.</p>
<p>I have looked around and found several "skeleton" frameworks. In addition to
the answers in my question, there is Tonic, a REST framework I like because it
is very lightweight.</p>
<p>I like REST the best for its simplicity, and would like to create an API
architecture based on it. I'm trying to get my head around the basic
principles and have not fully understood it yet. Therefore, a number of
questions.</p>
<p><strong>1. Am I understanding it right?</strong></p>
<p>Say I have a resource "users". I could set up a number of URIs like so:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">/api/users     when called with GET, lists users
/api/users     when called with POST, creates user record
/api/users/1   when called with GET, shows user record
               when called with PUT, updates user record
               when called with DELETE, deletes user record
</pre></div>

<p>is this a correct representation of a RESTful architecture so far?</p>
<p><strong>2. I need more verbs</strong></p>
<p>Create, Update and Delete may be enough in theory, but in practice I will have
the need for a lot more verbs. I realize these are things that <em>could</em> be
embedded in an update request, but they are specific actions that can have
specific return codes and I wouldn't want to throw them all into one action.</p>
<p>Some that come to mind in the user example are:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">activate_login
deactivate_login
change_password
add_credit
</pre></div>

<p>how would I express actions such as those in a RESTful URL architecture?</p>
<p>My instinct would be to do a GET call to a URL like</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">/api/users/1/activate_login
</pre></div>

<p>and expect a status code back.</p>
<p>That deviates from the idea of using HTTP verbs, though. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>3. How to return error messages and codes</strong></p>
<p>A great part of REST's beauty stems from its use of standard HTTP methods. On
an error, I emit a header with a 3xx,4xx or 5xx error status code. For a
detailed error description, I can use the body (right?). So far so good. But
what would be the way to transmit a <strong>proprietary error code</strong> that is more
detailed in describing what went wrong (e.g. "failed to connect to database",
or "database login wrong")? If I put it into the body along with the message,
I have to parse it out afterwards. Is there a standard header for this kind of
thing?</p>
<p><strong>4. How to do authentication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What would a API key based authentication following REST principles look like?</li>
<li>Are there strong points against using sessions when authenticating a REST client, other than that it's a blatant violation of the REST principle? :) (only half kidding here, session based authentication would play well with my existing infrastructure.)</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I noticed this question a couple of days late, but I feel that I can add some
insight. I hope this can be helpful towards your RESTful venture.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Point 1: Am I understanding it right?</strong></p>
<p>You understood right. That is a correct representation of a RESTful
architecture. You may find the following matrix from Wikipedia very helpful in
defining your nouns and verbs:</p>
<hr>
<p>When dealing with a <strong>Collection</strong> URI like:
<strong><code>http://example.com/resources/</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GET</strong> : List the members of the collection, complete with their member URIs for further navigation. For example, list all the cars for sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PUT</strong> : Meaning defined as "replace the entire collection with another collection".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POST</strong> : Create a new entry in the collection where the ID is assigned automatically by the collection. The ID created is usually included as part of the data returned by this operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DELETE</strong> : Meaning defined as "delete the entire collection".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>When dealing with a <strong>Member</strong> URI like:
<strong><code>http://example.com/resources/7HOU57Y</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GET</strong> : Retrieve a representation of the addressed member of the collection expressed in an appropriate MIME type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PUT</strong> : Update the addressed member of the collection or create it with the specified ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POST</strong> : Treats the addressed member as a collection in its own right and creates a new subordinate of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DELETE</strong> : Delete the addressed member of the collection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Point 2: I need more verbs</strong></p>
<p>In general, when you think you need more verbs, it may actually mean that your
resources need to be re-identified. Remember that in REST you are always
acting on a resource, or on a collection of resources. What you choose as the
resource is quite important for your API definition.</p>
<p><strong>Activate/Deactivate Login</strong> : If you are creating a new session, then you
may want to consider "the session" as the resource. To create a new session,
use POST to <code>http://example.com/sessions/</code> with the credentials in the body.
To expire it use PUT or a DELETE (maybe depending on whether you intend to
keep a session history) to <code>http://example.com/sessions/SESSION_ID</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Change Password:</strong> This time the resource is "the user". You would need a
PUT to <code>http://example.com/users/USER_ID</code> with the old and new passwords in
the body. You are acting on "the user" resource, and a change password is
simply an update request. It's quite similar to the UPDATE statement in a
relational database.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My instinct would be to do a GET call to a URL like
<code>/api/users/1/activate_login</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This goes against a very core REST principle: The correct usage of HTTP verbs.
Any GET request should never leave any side effect.</p>
<p>For example, a GET request should never create a session on the database,
return a cookie with a new Session ID, or leave any residue on the server. The
GET verb is like the SELECT statement in a database engine. Remember that the
response to any request with the GET verb should be cache-able when requested
with the same parameters, just like when you request a static web page.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Point 3: How to return error messages and codes</strong></p>
<p>Consider the 4xx or 5xx HTTP status codes as error categories. You can
elaborate the error in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Failed to Connect to Database:</strong> / <strong>Incorrect Database Login</strong> : In general
you should use a 500 error for these types of errors. This is a server-side
error. The client did nothing wrong. 500 errors are normally considered
"retryable". i.e. the client can retry the same exact request, and expect it
to succeed once the server's troubles are resolved. Specify the details in the
body, so that the client will be able to provide some context to us humans.</p>
<p>The other category of errors would be the 4xx family, which in general
indicate that the client did something wrong. In particular, this category of
errors normally indicate to the client that there is no need to retry the
request as it is, because it will continue to fail permanently. i.e. the
client needs to change something before retrying this request. For example,
"Resource not found" (HTTP 404) or "Malformed Request" (HTTP 400) errors would
fall in this category.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Point 4: How to do authentication</strong></p>
<p>As pointed out in point 1, instead of authenticating a user, you may want to
think about creating a session. You will be returned a new "Session ID", along
with the appropriate HTTP status code (200: Access Granted or 403: Access
Denied).</p>
<p>You will then be asking your RESTful server: "Can you GET me the resource for
this Session ID?".</p>
<p>There is no authenticated mode - REST is stateless: You create a session, you
ask the server to give you resources using this Session ID as a parameter, and
on logout you drop or expire the session.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Simply put, you are doing this completely backward.</p>
<p>You should not be approaching this from what URLs you should be using. The
URLs will effectively come "for free" once you've decided upon what resources
are necessary for your system AND how you will represent those resources, and
the interactions between the resources and application state.</p>
<p>To quote Roy Fielding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the
media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state,
or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for
existing standard media types. Any effort spent describing what methods to
use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of
the processing rules for a media type (and, in most cases, already defined
by existing media types). [Failure here implies that out-of-band information
is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folks always start with the URIs and think this is the solution, and then they
tend to miss a key concept in REST architecture, notably, as quoted above,
"Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction
instead of hypertext."</p>
<p>To be honest, many see a bunch of URIs and some GETs and PUTs and POSTs and
think REST is easy. REST is not easy. RPC over HTTP is easy, moving blobs of
data back and forth proxied through HTTP payloads is easy. REST, however, goes
beyond that. REST is protocol agnostic. HTTP is just very popular and apt for
REST systems.</p>
<p>REST lives in the media types, their definitions, and how the application
drives the actions available to those resources via hypertext (links,
effectively).</p>
<p>There are different view about media types in REST systems. Some favor
application specific payloads, while others like uplifting existing media
types in to roles that are appropriate for the application. For example, on
the one hand you have specific XML schemas designed suited to your application
versus using something like XHTML as your representation, perhaps through
microformats and other mechanisms.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their place, I think, the XHTML working very well in
scenarios that overlap both the human driven and machine driven web, whereas
the former, more specific data types I feel better facilitate machine to
machine interactions. I find the uplifting of commodity formats can make
content negotiation potentially difficult. "application/xml+yourresource" is
much more specific as a media type than "application/xhtml+xml", as the latter
can apply to many payloads which may or may not be something a machine client
is actually interested in, nor can it determine without introspection.</p>
<p>However, XHTML works very well (obviously) in the human web where web browsers
and rendering is very important.</p>
<p>You application will guide you in those kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>Part of the process of designing a REST system is discovering the first class
resources in your system, along with the derivative, support resources
necessary to support the operations on the primary resources. Once the
resources are discovered, then the representation of those resources, as well
as the state diagrams showing resource flow via hypertext within the
representations because the next challenge.</p>
<p>Recall that each representation of a resource, in a hypertext system, combines
both the actual resource representation along with the state transitions
available to the resource. Consider each resource a node in a graph, with the
links being the lines leaving that node to other states. These links inform
clients not only what can be done, but what is required for them to be done
(as a good link combines the URI and the media type required).</p>
<p>For example, you may have:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;link href="http://example.com/users" rel="users" type="application/xml+usercollection"/&gt;
&lt;link href="http://example.com/users?search" rel="search" type="application/xml+usersearchcriteria"/&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Your documentation will talk about the rel field named "users", and the media
type of "application/xml+youruser".</p>
<p>These links may seem redundant, they're all talking to the same URI, pretty
much. But they're not.</p>
<p>This is because for the "users" relation, that link is talking about the
collection of users, and you can use the uniform interface to work with the
collection (GET to retrieve all of them, DELETE to delete all of them, etc.)</p>
<p>If you POST to this URL, you will need to pass a
"application/xml+usercollection" document, which will probably only contain a
single user instance within the document so you can add the user, or not,
perhaps, to add several at once. Perhaps your documentation will suggest that
you can simply pass a single user type, instead of the collection.</p>
<p>You can see what the application requires in order to perform a search, as
defined by the "search" link and it's mediatype. The documentation for the
search media type will tell you how this behaves, and what to expect as
results.</p>
<p>The takeaway here, though, is the URIs themselves are basically unimportant.
The application is in control of the URIs, not the clients. Beyond a few
'entry points', your clients should rely on the URIs provided by the
application for its work.</p>
<p>The client needs to know how to manipulate and interpret the media types, but
doesn't much need to care where it goes.</p>
<p>These two links are semantically identical in a clients eyes:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;link href="http://example.com/users?search" rel="search" type="application/xml+usersearchcriteria"/&gt;
&lt;link href="http://example.com/AW163FH87SGV" rel="search" type="application/xml+usersearchcriteria"/&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>So, focus on your resources. Focus on their state transitions in the
application and how that's best achieved.</p>
