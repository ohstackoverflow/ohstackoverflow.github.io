    <p>We are compiling an embedded C++ application that is deployed in a shielded
device in an environment bombarded with ionizing radiation. We are using GCC
and cross-compiling for ARM. When deployed, our application generates some
erroneous data and crashes more often than we would like. The hardware is
designed for this environment, and our application has run on this platform
for several years.</p>
<p>Are there changes we can make to our code, or compile-time improvements that
can be made to identify/correct soft errors and memory-corruption caused by
single event upsets? Have any other developers had success in reducing the
harmful effects of soft errors on a long-running application?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Working for about 4-5 years with software/firmware development and environment
testing of miniaturized satellites*, I would like to share my experience here.</p>
<p>*( <em>miniaturized satellites are a lot more prone to single event upsets than bigger satellites due to its relatively small, limited sizes for its electronic components</em> )</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be very concise and direct: there is no mechanism to recover from
<em>detectable, erroneous situation</em> by the software/firmware itself <em>without</em>
, at least, one <em>copy</em> of <em>minimum working version</em> of the software/firmware
<em>somewhere</em> for <em>recovery</em> purpose - and with the <em>hardware supporting the
recovery</em> (functional).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this situation is normally handled both in the hardware and software
level. Here, as you request, I will share what we can do in the software
level.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>...recovery purpose...</strong>. Provide ability to update/recompile/reflash your software/firmware in real environment. This is an <em>almost must-have</em> feature for any software/firmware in highly ionized environment. Without this, you <em>could</em> have redundant software/hardware as many as you want but at one point, they are all going to blow up. So, prepare this feature!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>...minimum working version...</strong> Have responsive, multiple copies, minimum version of the software/firmware in your code. This is like Safe mode in Windows. Instead of having only one, fully functional version of your software, have multiple copies of the minimum version of your software/firmware. The minimum copy will usually having much less size than the full copy and almost always have <em>only</em> the following two or three features: </p>
<ol>
<li>capable of listening to command from external system, </li>
<li>capable of updating the current software/firmware, </li>
<li>capable of monitoring the basic operation's housekeeping data.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>...copy... somewhere...</strong> Have redundant software/firmware somewhere. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could, with <em>or</em> without redundant hardware, try to have redundant software/firmware in your ARM uC. This is normally done by having two or more identical software/firmware <em>in separate addresses</em> which sending heartbeat to each other - but only one will be active at a time. If one or more software/firmware is known to be unresponsive, switch to the other software/firmware. The benefit of using this approach is we can have functional replacement immediately after an error occurs - without any contact with whatever external system/party who is responsible to detect and to repair the error (in satellite case, it is usually the Mission Control Centre (MCC)). </p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Strictly speaking, without redundant hardware, the disadvantage of doing this
is you actually <em>cannot</em> eliminate <em>all</em> single point of failures. At the very
least, you will still have <em>one</em> single point of failure, which is <em>the switch
itself</em> (or often the beginning of the code). Nevertheless, for a device
limited by size in a highly ionized environment (such as pico/femto
satellites), the reduction of the single point of failures to one point
<em>without</em> additional hardware will still be worth considering. Somemore, the
piece of code for the switching would certainly be much less than the code for
the whole program - significantly reducing the risk of getting Single Event in
it.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>...detectable erroneous situation..</strong> The error must be <em>detectable</em> , usually by the hardware <em>error correction/detection circuit</em> or by a small piece of code for error correction/detection. It is best to put such code small, multiple, and <em>independent</em> from the main software/firmware. Its main task is <em>only</em> for checking/correcting. If the hardware circuit/firmware is <em>reliable</em> (such as it is more radiation hardened than the rests - or having multiple circuits/logics), then you might consider making error-correction with it. But if it is not, it is better to make it as error-detection. The correction can be by external system/device. For the error correction, you could consider making use of a basic error correction algorithm like Hamming/Golay23, because they can be implemented more easily both in the circuit/software. But it ultimately depends on your team's capability. For error detection, normally CRC is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>...hardware supporting the recovery</strong> Now, comes to the most difficult aspect on this issue. Ultimately, the recovery requires the hardware which is responsible for the recovery to be <em>at least</em> functional. If the hardware is permanently broken (normally happen after its <strong>Total ionizing dose</strong> reaches certain level), then there is (sadly) no way for the software to help in recovery. Thus, hardware is rightly the utmost importance concern for a device exposed to high radiation level (such as satellite). </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the suggestion for above anticipating firmware's error due to
single event upset, I would also like to suggest you to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Error detection and/or error correction algorithm in the inter-subsystem communication protocol. This is another almost must have in order to avoid incomplete/wrong signals received from other system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filter in your ADC reading. Do <em>not</em> use the ADC reading directly. Filter it by median filter, mean filter, or any other filters - <em>never</em> trust single reading value. Sample more, not less - reasonably.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>NASA has a paper on radiation-hardened software. It describes three main
tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regular monitoring of memory for errors then scrubbing out those errors,</li>
<li>robust error recovery mechanisms, and</li>
<li>the ability to reconfigure if something no longer works.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the memory scan rate should be frequent enough that multi-bit errors
rarely occur, as most ECC memory can recover from single-bit errors, not
multi-bit errors.</p>
<p>Robust error recovery includes control flow transfer (typically restarting a
process at a point before the error), resource release, and data restoration.</p>
<p>Their main recommendation for data restoration is to avoid the need for it,
through having intermediate data be treated as temporary, so that restarting
before the error also rolls back the data to a reliable state. This sounds
similar to the concept of "transactions" in databases.</p>
<p>They discuss techniques particularly suitable for object-oriented languages
such as C++. For example</p>
<ol>
<li>Software-based ECCs for contiguous memory objects</li>
<li>Programming by Contract: verifying preconditions and postconditions, then checking the object to verify it is still in a valid state.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, it just so happens, NASA has used C++ for major projects such as the Mars
Rover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C++ class abstraction and encapsulation enabled rapid development and
testing among multiple projects and developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They avoided certain C++ features that could create problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Iostream (no console)</li>
<li>Multiple inheritance</li>
<li>Operator overloading (other than <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>)</li>
<li>Dynamic allocation (used a dedicated memory pool and placement <code>new</code> to avoid the possibility of system heap corruption).</li>
</ol>
