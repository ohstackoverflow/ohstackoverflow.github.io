    <p>When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should
represent it with:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">football_team</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">FootballPlayer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are
listed in the roster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere
list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of
scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a <code>string</code>
representing the name of the team, etc..</p>
<p>So then I think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it
has a name (a <code>string</code>) and a running total of scores (an <code>int</code>). .NET does
not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class.
The most similar and relevant existing structure is <code>List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</code>,
so I will inherit from it:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">FootballTeam</span> : <span class="nb">List</span><span class="s">&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</span>
{
    <span class="n">public</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">TeamName</span>;
    <span class="n">public</span> <span class="n">int</span> <span class="n">RunningTotal</span>
}
</pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.
I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.</p>
<h3>Why not?</h3>
<p>Apparently <code>List</code> is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What
performance problems will I cause if I extend <code>List</code>? What exactly will break?</p>
<p>Another reason I've seen is that <code>List</code> is provided by Microsoft, and I have
no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a "public
API". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I
care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this
public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from <code>List</code>
<em>and</em> it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?</p>
<p>Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What
could I possibly want to change?</p>
<p>And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from <code>List</code>, why didn't
they make the class <code>sealed</code>?</p>
<h3>What else am I supposed to use?</h3>
<p>Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a <code>Collection</code>
class which should be extended instead of <code>List</code>. But this class is very bare,
and does not have many useful things, such as <code>AddRange</code>, for instance.
jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method,
but how is a slow <code>AddRange</code> not better than no <code>AddRange</code>?</p>
<p>Inheriting from <code>Collection</code> is way more work than inheriting from <code>List</code>, and
I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no
reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something,
and inheriting <code>Collection</code> is actually not the right solution for my problem.</p>
<p>I've seen suggestions such as implementing <code>IList</code>. Just no. This is dozens of
lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.</p>
<p>Lastly, some suggest wrapping the <code>List</code> in something:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">FootballTeam</span> 
{ 
    <span class="n">public</span> <span class="nb">List</span><span class="s">&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</span> <span class="n">Players</span>; 
}
</pre></div>

<p>There are two problems with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call <code>my_team.Players.Count</code> instead of just <code>my_team.Count</code>. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal <code>List</code>... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't "have" a list of players. It <em>is</em> the list of players. You don't say "John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players". You say "John has joined SomeTeam". You don't add a letter to "a string's characters", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I realize that what happens "under the hood" can be said to be "adding X to
Y's internal list", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of
thinking about the world.</p>
<h3>My question (summarized)</h3>
<p>What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which,
"logically" (that is to say, "to the human mind") is just a <code>list</code> of <code>things</code>
with a few bells and whistles?</p>
<p>Is inheriting from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable?
Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit
from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or not?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There are some good answers here. I would add to them the following points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which,
"logically" (that is to say, "to the human mind") is just a list of things
with a few bells and whistles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask any ten non-computer-programmer people who are familiar with the existence
of football to fill in the blank:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A football team is a particular kind of _____</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did <em>anyone</em> say "list of football players with a few bells and whistles", or
did they all say "sports team" or "club" or "organization"? Your notion that a
football team is <em>a particular kind of list of players</em> is in your human mind
and your human mind alone.</p>
<p><code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is a <em>mechanism</em>. Football team is a <em>business object</em> -- that is,
an object that represents some concept that is in the <em>business domain</em> of the
program. Don't mix those! A football team <em>is a kind of</em> team; it <em>has a</em>
roster, a roster <em>is a list of players</em>. A roster is not a <em>particular kind of
list of players</em>. A roster <em>is</em> a list of players. So make a property called
<code>Roster</code> that is a <code>List&lt;Player&gt;</code>. And make it <code>ReadOnlyList&lt;Player&gt;</code> while
you're at it, unless you believe that everyone who knows about a football team
gets to delete players from the roster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is inheriting from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> always unacceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unacceptable to whom? Me? No.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When is it acceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you're building a mechanism that <em>extends the<code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> mechanism</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from
<code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Am I building a <em>mechanism</em> or a <em>business object</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You spent more time typing up your question that it would have taken you to
write forwarding methods for the relevant members of <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> fifty times
over. You're clearly not afraid of verbosity, and we are talking about a very
small amount of code here; this is a few minutes work.</p>
<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>I gave it some more thought and there is another reason to not model a
football team as a list of players. In fact it might be a bad idea to model a
football team as <em>having</em> a list of players too. The problem with a team
as/having a list of players is that what you've got is a <em>snapshot</em> of the
team <em>at a moment in time</em>. I don't know what your business case is for this
class, but if I had a class that represented a football team I would want to
ask it questions like "how many Seahawks players missed games due to injury
between 2003 and 2013?" or "What Denver player who previously played for
another team had the largest year-over-year increase in yards ran?" or "Did
the Piggers go all the way this year?"</p>
<p>That is, a football team seems to me to be well modeled as <em>a collection of
historical facts</em> such as when a player was recruited, injured, retired, etc.
Obviously the current player roster is an important fact that should probably
be front-and-center, but there may be other interesting things you want to do
with this object that require a more historical perspective.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Wow, your post has an entire slew of questions and points. Most of the
reasoning you get from Microsoft is exactly on point. Let's start with
everything about <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> <strong>is</strong> highly optimized. Its main usage is to be used as a private member of an object.</li>
<li>Microsoft did not seal it because sometimes you might want to create a class that has a friendlier name: <code>class MyList&lt;T, TX&gt; : List&lt;CustomObject&lt;T, Something&lt;TX&gt;&gt; { ... }</code>. Now it's as easy as doing <code>var list = new MyList&lt;int, string&gt;();</code>.</li>
<li>CA1002: Do not expose generic lists: Basically, even if you plan to use this app as the sole developer, it's worthwhile to develop with good coding practices, so they become instilled into you and second nature. You are still allowed to expose the list as an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> if you need any consumer to have an indexed list. This lets you change the implementation within a class later on.</li>
<li>Microsoft made <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code> very generic because it is a generic concept... the name says it all; it is just a collection. There are more precise versions such as <code>SortedCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>ReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>, etc. each of which implement <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> but <strong>not</strong> <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code> allows for members (i.e. Add, Remove, etc.) to be overridden because they are virtual. <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> does not.</li>
<li>The last part of your question is spot on. A Football team is more than just a list of players, so it should be a class that contains that list of players. Think Composition vs Inheritance. A Football team <em>has</em> a list of players (a roster), it isn't a list of players.</li>
</ul>
