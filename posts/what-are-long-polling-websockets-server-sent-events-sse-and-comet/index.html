    <p>I have tried reading some articles, but I am not very clear on the concepts

<p>Would someone like to take a shot at explaining to me what these technologies
are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Long Polling</li>
<li>Server-Sent Events</li>
<li>Websockets</li>
<li>Comet</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that I came across every time was, the server keeps a connection
open and pushes data to the client. How is the connection kept open, and how
does the client get the pushed data? (How does the client use the data, maybe
some code might help?)</p>
<p>Now, which one of them should I use for a real-time app. I have been hearing a
lot about websockets (with socket.io [a node.js library]) but why not PHP?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><em>In the examples below the client is the browser and the server is the
webserver hosting the website.</em></p>
<p>Before you can understand these technologies, you have to understand <em>classic</em>
HTTP web traffic first.</p>
<h3>Regular HTTP:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A client requests a webpage from a server.</li>
<li>The server calculates the response</li>
<li>The server sends the response to the client. </li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="HTTP" src="../../images/TK1ZG.png"></p>
<h3>Ajax Polling:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A client requests a webpage from a server using regular HTTP (see HTTP above).</li>
<li>The client receives the requested webpage and executes the JavaScript on the page which requests a file from the server at regular intervals (e.g. 0.5 seconds).</li>
<li>The server calculates each response and sends it back, just like normal HTTP traffic.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Ajax Polling" src="../../images/qlMEU.png"></p>
<h3>Ajax Long-Polling:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A client requests a webpage from a server using regular HTTP (see HTTP above).</li>
<li>The client receives the requested webpage and executes the JavaScript on the page which requests a file from the server.</li>
<li>The server does not immediately respond with the requested information but waits until there's <strong>new</strong> information available.</li>
<li>When there's new information available, the server responds with the new information.</li>
<li>The client receives the new information and immediately sends another request to the server, re-starting the process. </li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Ajax Long-Polling" src="../../images/zLnOU.png"></p>
<h3>HTML5 Server Sent Events (SSE) / EventSource:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A client requests a webpage from a server using regular HTTP (see HTTP above).</li>
<li>The client receives the requested webpage and executes the JavaScript on the page which opens a connection to the server.</li>
<li>
<p>The server sends an event to the client when there's new information available. </p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time traffic from server to client, mostly that's what you'll need</li>
<li>You'll want to use a server that has an event loop</li>
<li>Connections with servers from other domains are only possible with correct CORS settings</li>
<li>If you want to read more, I found these very useful: (article), (article), (article), (tutorial).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="HTML5 SSE" src="../../images/ziR5h.png"></p>
<h3>HTML5 Websockets:</h3>
<ol>
<li>A client requests a webpage from a server using regular http (see HTTP above).</li>
<li>The client receives the requested webpage and executes the JavaScript on the page which opens a connection with the server.</li>
<li>
<p>The server and the client can now send each other messages when new data (on either side) is available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time traffic from the server to the client <strong>and</strong> from the client to the server</li>
<li>You'll want to use a server that has an event loop</li>
<li>With WebSockets it is possible to connect with a server from another domain.</li>
<li>It is also possible to use a third party hosted websocket server, for example Pusher or others. This way you'll only have to implement the client side, which is very easy!</li>
<li>If you want to read more, I found these very useful: (article), (article) (tutorial).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comet:</h3>
<p>Comet is a collection of techniques prior to HTML5 which use streaming and
long-polling to achieve real time applications. Read more on wikipedia or this
article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, which one of them should I use for a realtime app (that I need to
code). I have been hearing a lot about websockets (with socket.io [a node.js
library]) but why not PHP ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use PHP with WebSockets, check out Ratchet.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Tieme put a lot of effort into his excellent answer, but I think the core of
the OP's question is how these technologies relate to PHP rather than how each
technology works.</p>
<p>PHP is the most used language in web development besides the obvious client
side HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Yet PHP has 2 major issues when it comes to
real-time applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>PHP started as a very basic CGI. PHP has progressed very far since its early stage, but it happened in small steps. PHP already had many millions of users by the time it became the embed-able and flexible C library that it is today, most of whom were dependent on its earlier model of execution, so it hasn't yet made a solid attempt to escape the CGI model internally. Even the command line interface invokes the PHP library (<code>libphp5.so</code> on Linux, <code>php5ts.dll</code> on Windows, etc) as if it still a CGI processing a GET/POST request. It still executes code as if it just has to build a "page" and then end its life cycle. As a result, it has very little support for multi-thread or event-driven programming (within PHP userspace), making it currently unpractical for real-time, multi-user applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that PHP does have extensions to provide event loops (such as <code>libevent</code>)
and threads (such as <code>pthreads</code>) in PHP userspace, but very, very, few of the
applications use these.</p>
<ol>
<li>PHP still has significant issues with garbage collection. Although these issues have been consistently improving (likely its greatest step to end the life cycle as described above), even the best attempts at creating long-running PHP applications require being restarted on a regular basis. This also makes it unpractical for real-time applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>PHP 7 will be a great step to fix these issues as well, and seems very
promising as a platform for real-time applications.</p>
