    <p>How do map providers (such as Google or Yahoo! Maps) suggest directions?</p>
<p>I mean, they probably have real-world data in some form, certainly including
distances but also perhaps things like driving speeds, presence of sidewalks,
train schedules, etc. But suppose the data were in a simpler format, say a
very large directed graph with edge weights reflecting distances. I want to be
able to quickly compute directions from one arbitrary point to another.
Sometimes these points will be close together (within one city) while
sometimes they will be far apart (cross-country).</p>
<p>Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm will not work because the graph is
enormous. Luckily, heuristic algorithms like A* will probably work. However,
our data is very structured, and perhaps some kind of tiered approach might
work? (For example, store precomputed directions between certain "key" points
far apart, as well as some local directions. Then directions for two far-away
points will involve local directions to a key points, global directions to
another key point, and then local directions again.)</p>
<p>What algorithms are actually used in practice?</p>
<p>PS. This question was motivated by finding quirks in online mapping
directions. Contrary to the triangle inequality, sometimes Google Maps thinks
that X-Z takes longer and is farther than using an intermediate point as in
X-Y-Z. But maybe their walking directions optimize for another parameter, too?</p>
<p>PPS. Here's another violation of the triangle inequality that suggests (to me)
that they use some kind of tiered approach: X-Z versus X-Y-Z. The former seems
to use prominent Boulevard de Sebastopol even though it's slightly out of the
way.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> : Neither of these examples seem to work anymore, but both did at the
time of the original post.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Speaking as someone who spent 18 months working at a mapping company, which
included working on the routing algorithm... yes, Dijkstra's does work, with a
couple of modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of doing Dijkstra's once from source to dest, you start at each end, and expand both sides until they meet in the middle. This eliminates roughly half the work (2<em>pi</em>(r/2)^2 vs pi*r^2).</li>
<li>To avoid exploring the back-alleys of every city between your source and destination, you can have several layers of map data: A 'highways' layer that contains only highways, a 'secondary' layer that contains only secondary streets, and so forth. Then, you explore only smaller sections of the more detailed layers, expanding as necessary. Obviously this description leaves out a lot of detail, but you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>With modifications along those lines, you can do even cross-country routing in
a very reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>This question has been an active area of research in the last years. The main
idea is to do a <strong>preprocessing</strong> on the graph <strong>once</strong> , to <strong>speed up</strong> all
<strong>following queries</strong>. With this additional information itineraries can be
computed very fast. Still, <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong> is the basis for all
optimisations.</p>
<p><em>Arachnid</em> described the usage of bidirectional search and edge pruning based
on hierarchical information. These speedup techniques work quite well, but the
most recent algorithms outperform these techniques by all means. With current
algorithms a shortest paths can be computed in considerable less time than
<strong>one millisecond</strong> on a continental road network. A fast implementation of
the unmodified algorithm of Dijkstra needs about <strong>10 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>The article Engineering Fast Route Planning Algorithms gives an overview of
the progress of research in that field. See the references of that paper for
further information.</p>
<p>The fastest known algorithms do not use information about the hierarchical
status of the road in the data, i.e. if it is a highway or a local road.
Instead, they compute in a preprocessing step an own hierarchy that optimised
to speed up route planning. This precomputation can then be used to prune the
search: Far away from start and destination slow roads need not be considered
during Dijkstra's Algorithm. The benefits are very good <strong>performance</strong> and a
<strong>correctness</strong> guarantee for the result.</p>
<p>The first optimised route planning algorithms dealt only with static road
networks, that means an edge in the graph has a fixed cost value. This not
true in practice, since we want to take dynamic information like traffic jams
or vehicle dependent restrictrions into account. Latest algorithms can also
deal with such issues, but there are still problems to solve and the research
is going on.</p>
<p>If you need the shortest path distances to compute a solution for the <strong>TSP</strong>
, then you are probably interested in matrices that contain all distances
between your sources and destinations. For this you could consider Computing
Many-to-Many Shortest Paths Using Highway Hierarchies. Note, that this has
been improved by newer approaches in the last 2 years.</p>
