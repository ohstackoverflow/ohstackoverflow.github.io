    <p>Are there any compelling performance reasons to choose static linking over
dynamic linking or vice versa in certain situations? I've heard or read the
following, but I don't know enough on the subject to vouch for its veracity.</p>
<p>1) The difference in runtime performance between static linking and dynamic
linking is usually negligible.</p>
<p>2) (1) is not true if using a profiling compiler that uses profile data to
optimize program hotpaths because with static linking, the compiler can
optimize both your code and the library code. With dynamic linking only your
code can be optimized. If most of the time is spent running library code, this
can make a big difference. Otherwise, (1) still applies.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic</strong> linking can <strong>reduce total resource consumption</strong> (if more than one process shares the same library (including the version in "the same", of course)). I believe this is the argument that drives its presence in most environments. Here "resources" include disk space, RAM, and cache space. Of course, if your dynamic linker is insufficiently flexible there is a risk of DLL hell.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic</strong> linking means that bug fixes and upgrades to libraries <strong>propagate</strong> to improve <em>your</em> product without requiring you to ship anything.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plugins</strong> always call for <strong>dynamic</strong> linking.</li>
<li>
<strong>Static</strong> linking, means that you can know the code will run in very <strong>limited environments</strong> (early in the boot process, or in rescue mode).</li>
<li>
<strong>Static</strong> linking can make binaries <strong>easier to distribute</strong> to diverse user environments (at the cost of sending a larger and more resource-hungry program).</li>
<li>
<strong>Static</strong> linking may allow slightly <strong>faster startup</strong> times, but this depends to some degree on both the size and complexity of your program <em>and</em> on the details of the OS's loading strategy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Some edits to include the very relevant suggestions in the comments and in
other answers. I'd like to note that the way you break on this depends a lot
on what environment you plan to run in. Minimal embedded systems may not have
enough resources to support dynamic linking. Slightly larger small systems may
well support dynamic linking because their memory is small enough to make the
RAM savings from dynamic linking very attractive. Full-blown consumer PCs
have, as Mark notes, enormous resources, and you can probably let the
convenience issues drive your thinking on this matter.</p>
<hr>
<p>To address the performance and efficiency issues: <strong>it depends</strong>.</p>
<p>Classically, dynamic libraries require some kind of glue layer which often
means double dispatch or an extra layer of indirection in function addressing
and can cost a little speed (but is the function calling time actually a big
part of your running time???).</p>
<p>However, if you are running multiple processes which all call the same library
a lot, you can end up saving cache lines (and thus winning on running
performance) when using dynamic linking relative to using static linking.
(Unless modern OS's are smart enough to notice identical segments in
statically linked binaries. Seems hard, does anyone know?)</p>
<p>Another issue: loading time. You pay loading costs at some point. When you pay
this cost depends on how the OS works as well as what linking you use. Maybe
you'd rather put off paying it until you know you need it.</p>
<p>Note that static-vs-dynamic linking is traditionally <em>not</em> an optimization
issue, because they both involve separate compilation down to object files.
However, this is not required: a compiler can in principle, "compile" "static
libraries" to a digested AST form initially, and "link" them by adding those
ASTs to the ones generated for the main code, thus empowering global
optimization. None of the systems I use do this, so I can't comment on how
well it works.</p>
<p>The way to answer performance questions is <em>always</em> by testing (and use a test
environment as much like the deployment environment as possible).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>1) is based on the fact that calling a DLL function is always using an extra
indirect jump. Today, this is usually negligible. Inside the DLL there is some
more overhead on i386 CPU's, because they can't generate position independent
code. On amd64, jumps can be relative to the program counter, so this is a
huge improvement.</p>
<p>2) This is correct. With optimizations guided by profiling you can usually win
about 10-15 percent performance. Now that CPU speed has reached its limits it
might be worth doing it.</p>
<p>I would add: (3) the linker can arrange functions in a more cache efficient
grouping, so that expensive cache level misses are minimised. It also might
especially effect the startup time of applications (based on results i have
seen with the Sun C++ compiler)</p>
<p>And don't forget that with DLLs no dead code elimination can be performed.
Depending on the language, the DLL code might not be optimal either. Virtual
functions are always virtual because the compiler doesn't know whether a
client is overwriting it.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in case there is no real need for DLLs, then just use
static compilation.</p>
<p>EDIT (to answer the comment, by user underscore)</p>
<p>Here is a good resource about the position independent code problem
http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-
shared-libraries/</p>
<p>As explained x86 does not have them AFAIK for anything else then 15 bit jump
ranges and not for unconditional jumps and calls. That's why functions (from
generators) having more then 32K have always been a problem and needed
embedded trampolines.</p>
<p>But on popular x86 OS like Linux you do not need to care if the .so/DLL file
is not generated with the <code>gcc</code> switch <code>-fpic</code> (which enforces the use of the
indirect jump tables). Because if you don't, the code is just fixed like a
normal linker would relocate it. But while doing this it makes the code
segment non shareable and it would need a full mapping of the code from disk
into memory and touching it all before it can be used (emptying most of the
caches, hitting TLBs) etc. There was a time when this was considered slow.</p>
<p>So you would not have any benefit anymore.</p>
<p>I do not recall what OS (Solaris or FreeBSD) gave me problems with my Unix
build system because I just wasn't doing this and wondered why it crashed
until I applied <code>-fPIC</code> to <code>gcc</code>.</p>
