    <p>I'm using React-router and it works fine while I'm clicking on link buttons,
but when I refresh my webpage it does not load what I want.</p>
<p>For instance, I am in <code>localhost/joblist</code> and everything is fine because I
arrived here pressing a link. But <em>if</em> I refresh the webpage I get:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Cannot GET /joblist

<p>By default, it didn't work like this. Initially I had my URL as <code>localhost/#/</code>
and <code>localhost/#/joblist</code> and they worked perfectly fine. But I don't like
this kind of URL, so trying to erase that <code>#</code>, I wrote:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Router.run(routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {
 React.render(&lt;Handler/&gt;, document.body);
});
</pre></div>

<p>This problem does not happen with <code>localhost/</code>, this one always returns what I
want.</p>
<p>This app is single-page, so <code>/joblist</code> doesn't need to ask anything to any
server.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>Server-side vs Client-side</h4>
<p>The first big thing to understand about this is that there are now 2 places
where the URL is interpreted, whereas there used to be only 1 in 'the old
days'. In the past, when life was simple, some user sent a request for
<code>http://example.com/about</code> to the server, which inspected the path part of the
URL, determined the user was requesting the about page, and then sent back
that page.</p>
<p>With client-side routing, which is what React Router provides, things are less
simple. At first, the client does not have any JavaScript code loaded yet. So
the very first request will always be to the server. That will then return a
page that contains the needed script tags to load React and React Router, etc.
Only when those scripts have loaded does phase 2 start. In phase 2, when the
user clicks on the 'About us' navigation link, for example, the URL is changed
<em>locally only</em> to <code>http://example.com/about</code> (made possible by the History
API), but <strong>no request to the server is made</strong>. Instead, React Router does its
thing on the client-side, determines which React view to render, and renders
it. Assuming your about page does not need to make any REST calls, it's done
already. You have transitioned from <em>Home</em> to <em>About Us</em> without any server
request having fired.</p>
<p>So basically when you click a link, some JavaScript runs that manipulates the
URL in the address bar, <em>without causing a page refresh</em> , which in turn
causes React Router to perform a page transition <strong>on the client-side</strong>.</p>
<p>But now consider what happens if you copy-paste the URL in the address bar and
e-mail it to a friend. Your friend has not loaded your website yet. In other
words, she is still in <em>phase 1</em>. No React Router is running on her machine
yet. So her browser will make a <strong>server request</strong> to
<code>http://example.com/about</code>.</p>
<p>And this is where your trouble starts. Until now, you could get away with just
placing a static HTML at the webroot of your server. But that would give <em>404</em>
errors for all other URLs <em>when requested from the server</em>. Those same URLs
work fine <em>on the client-side</em> , because there React Router is doing the
routing for you, but they fail <em>on the server-side</em> unless you make your
server understand them.</p>
<h4>Combining server- and client-side routing</h4>
<p>If you want the <code>http://example.com/about</code> URL to work on both the server- and
the client-side, you need to set up routes for it on both the server- and the
client-side. It makes sense, right?</p>
<p>And this is where your choices begin. Solutions range from bypassing the
problem altogether, via a catch-all route that returns the bootstrap HTML, to
the full-on isomorphic approach where both the server and the client run the
same JavaScript code.</p>
<h3>Bypassing the problem altogether: Hash History</h3>
<p>With Hash History, instead of Browser History, your URL for the about page
would look something like this: <code>http://example.com/#/about</code></p>
<p>The part after the hash (<code>#</code>) symbol is not sent to the server. So the server
only sees <code>http://example.com/</code> and sends the index page as expected. React
Router will pick up the <code>#/about</code> part and show the correct page.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>'ugly' URLs</li>
<li>Server-side rendering is not possible with this approach. As far as search engine optimization (SEO) is concerned, your website consists of a single page with hardly any content on it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Catch-all</h3>
<p>With this approach, you do use the Browser History, but just set up a catch-
all on the server that sends <code>/*</code> to <code>index.html</code>, effectively giving you much
the same situation as with Hash History. You do have clean URLs however and
you could improve upon this scheme later without having to invalidate all your
user's favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>More complex to set up</li>
<li>Still no good SEO</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hybrid</h3>
<p>In the hybrid approach, you expand upon the catch-all scenario by adding
specific scripts for specific routes. You could make some simple PHP scripts
to return the most important pages of your site with content included, so
Googlebot can at least see what's on your page.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Even more complex to set up</li>
<li>Only good SEO for those routes you give the special treatment</li>
<li>Duplicating code for rendering content on server and client</li>
</ul>
<h3>Isomorphic</h3>
<p>What if we use Node.js as our server so we can run <em>the same</em> JavaScript code
on both ends? Now, we have all our routes defined in a single react-router
configuration and we don't need to duplicate our rendering code. This is 'the
holy grail' so to speak. The server sends the exact same markup as we would
end up with if the page transition had happened on the client. This solution
is optimal in terms of SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Server <em>must</em> (be able to) run JavaScript. I've experimented with Java in conjunction with Nashorn, but it's not working for me. In practice, it mostly means you must use a Node.js based server.</li>
<li>Many tricky environmental issues (using <code>window</code> on server-side, etc.)</li>
<li>Steep learning curve</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which should I use?</h4>
<p>Choose the one that you can get away with. Personally, I think the catch-all
is simple enough to set up, so that would be my minimum. This setup allows you
to improve on things over time. If you are already using Node.js as your
server platform, I'd definitely investigate doing an isomorphic app. Yes, it's
tough at first, but once you get the hang of it it's actually a very elegant
solution to the problem.</p>
<p>So basically, for me, that would be the deciding factor. If my server runs on
Node.js, I'd go isomorphic; otherwise, I would go for the Catch-all solution
and just expand on it (Hybrid solution) as time progresses and SEO
requirements demand it.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about isomorphic (also called 'universal')
rendering with React, there are some good tutorials on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>React to the future with isomorphic apps</li>
<li>The Pain and the Joy of creating isomorphic apps in ReactJS</li>
<li>How to Implement Node + React Isomorphic JavaScript &amp; Why it Matters</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, to get you started, I recommend looking at some starter kits. Pick one
that matches your choices for the technology stack (remember, React is just
the V in MVC, you need more stuff to build a full app). Start with looking at
the one published by Facebook itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create React App</li>
</ul>
<p>Or pick one of the many by the community. There is a nice site now that tries
to index all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick your perfect React starter project</li>
</ul>
<p>I started with these:</p>
<ul>
<li>React Isomorphic Starterkit</li>
<li>React Redux Universal Hot Example</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I am using a homebrewed version of universal rendering that was
inspired by the two starter kits above, but they are out of date now.</p>
<p>Good luck with your quest!</p>

<p>If you are using Apache as your web server, you can insert this into your
<code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<p>I am using <code>react: "^16.12.0"</code> and <code>react-router: "^5.1.2"</code> This method is the
Catch-all and is probably the easiest way to get you started.</p>
