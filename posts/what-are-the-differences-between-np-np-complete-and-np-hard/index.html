    <p>What are the differences between <strong>NP</strong> , <strong>NP-Complete</strong> and <strong>NP-Hard</strong>?</p>
<p>I am aware of many resources all over the web. I'd like to read your
explanations, and the reason is they might be different from what's out there,
or there is something that I'm not aware of.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I assume that you are looking for intuitive definitions, since the technical
definitions require quite some time to understand. First of all, let's
remember a preliminary needed concept to understand those definitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Decision problem</strong> : A problem with a <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>no</strong> answer.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now, let us define those <em>complexity classes</em>.</p>
<h2>P</h2>
<p><em>P is a complexity class that represents the set of all decision problems that
can be solved in polynomial time</em>.</p>
<p>That is, given an instance of the problem, the answer yes or no can be decided
in polynomial time.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Given a connected graph <code>G</code>, can its vertices be coloured using two colours so
that no edge is monochromatic?</p>
<p>Algorithm: start with an arbitrary vertex, color it red and all of its
neighbours blue and continue. Stop when you run out of vertices or you are
forced to make an edge have both of its endpoints be the same color.</p>
<hr>
<h2>NP</h2>
<p><em>NP is a complexity class that represents the set of all decision problems for
which the instances where the answer is "yes" have proofs that can be verified
in polynomial time.</em></p>
<p>This means that if someone gives us an instance of the problem and a
certificate (sometimes called a witness) to the answer being yes, we can check
that it is correct in polynomial time.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p><em>Integer factorisation</em> is in NP. This is the problem that given integers <code>n</code>
and <code>m</code>, is there an integer <code>f</code> with <code>1 &lt; f &lt; m</code>, such that <code>f</code> divides <code>n</code>
(<code>f</code> is a small factor of <code>n</code>)?</p>
<p>This is a decision problem because the answers are yes or no. If someone hands
us an instance of the problem (so they hand us integers <code>n</code> and <code>m</code>) and an
integer <code>f</code> with <code>1 &lt; f &lt; m</code>, and claim that <code>f</code> is a factor of <code>n</code> (the
certificate), we can check the answer in <em>polynomial time</em> by performing the
division <code>n / f</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>NP-Complete</h2>
<p><em>NP-Complete is a complexity class which represents the set of all problems<code>X</code>
in NP for which it is possible to reduce any other NP problem <code>Y</code> to <code>X</code> in
polynomial time.</em></p>
<p>Intuitively this means that we can solve <code>Y</code> quickly if we know how to solve
<code>X</code> quickly. Precisely, <code>Y</code> is reducible to <code>X</code>, if there is a polynomial time
algorithm <code>f</code> to transform instances <code>y</code> of <code>Y</code> to instances <code>x = f(y)</code> of <code>X</code>
in polynomial time, with the property that the answer to <code>y</code> is yes, if and
only if the answer to <code>f(y)</code> is yes.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p><code>3-SAT</code>. This is the problem wherein we are given a conjunction (ANDs) of
3-clause disjunctions (ORs), statements of the form</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">(x_v11 OR x_v21 OR x_v31) AND 
(x_v12 OR x_v22 OR x_v32) AND 
...                       AND 
(x_v1n OR x_v2n OR x_v3n)
</pre></div>

<p>where each <code>x_vij</code> is a boolean variable or the negation of a variable from a
finite predefined list <code>(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)</code>.</p>
<p>It can be shown that <em>every NP problem can be reduced to 3-SAT</em>. The proof of
this is technical and requires use of the technical definition of NP ( <em>based
on non-deterministic Turing machines</em> ). This is known as <em>Cook's theorem</em>.</p>
<p>What makes NP-complete problems important is that if a deterministic
polynomial time algorithm can be found to solve one of them, every NP problem
is solvable in polynomial time (one problem to rule them all).</p>
<hr>
<h2>NP-hard</h2>
<p>Intuitively, these are the problems that are <em>at least as hard as the NP-
complete problems</em>. Note that NP-hard problems <em>do not have to be in NP</em> , and
<em>they do not have to be decision problems</em>.</p>
<p>The precise definition here is that <em>a problem<code>X</code> is NP-hard, if there is an
NP-complete problem <code>Y</code>, such that <code>Y</code> is reducible to <code>X</code> in polynomial
time</em>.</p>
<p>But since any NP-complete problem can be reduced to any other NP-complete
problem in polynomial time, all NP-complete problems can be reduced to any NP-
hard problem in polynomial time. Then, if there is a solution to one NP-hard
problem in polynomial time, there is a solution to all NP problems in
polynomial time.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The halting problem is an NP-hard problem. This is the problem that given a
program <code>P</code> and input <code>I</code>, will it halt? This is a decision problem but it is
not in NP. It is clear that any NP-complete problem can be reduced to this
one. As another example, any NP-complete problem is NP-hard.</p>
<p>My favorite NP-complete problem is the Minesweeper problem.</p>
<hr>
<h2>P = NP</h2>
<p>This one is the most famous problem in computer science, and one of the most
important outstanding questions in the mathematical sciences. In fact, the
Clay Institute is offering one million dollars for a solution to the problem
(Stephen Cook's writeup on the Clay website is quite good).</p>
<p>It's clear that P is a subset of NP. The open question is whether or not NP
problems have deterministic polynomial time solutions. It is largely believed
that they do not. Here is an outstanding recent article on the latest (and the
importance) of the P = NP problem: The Status of the P versus NP problem.</p>
<p>The best book on the subject is Computers and Intractability by Garey and
Johnson.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I've been looking around and seeing many long explanations. Here is a small
chart that may be useful to summarise:</p>
<p>Notice how difficulty increases top to bottom: any <em>NP can be reduced to NP-
Complete</em> , and any <em>NP-Complete can be reduced to NP-Hard</em> , all in P
(polynomial) time.</p>
<p>If you can solve a more difficult class of problem in P time, that will mean
you found how to solve all easier problems in P time (for example, proving P =
NP, if you figure out how to solve any NP-Complete problem in P time).</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">____________________________________________________________
| Problem Type | Verifiable in P time | Solvable in P time | Increasing Difficulty
___________________________________________________________|           |
| P            |        Yes           |        Yes         |           |
| NP           |        Yes           |     Yes or No *    |           |
| NP-Complete  |        Yes           |      Unknown       |           |
| NP-Hard      |     Yes or No **     |      Unknown ***   |           |

<p>Notes on <code>Yes</code> or <code>No</code> entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>An NP problem that is also P is solvable in P time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>** An NP-Hard problem that is also NP-Complete is verifiable in P time.</li>
<li>*** NP-Complete problems (all of which form a subset of NP-hard) might be. The rest of NP hard is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found this diagram quite useful in seeing how all these types
correspond to each other (pay more attention to the left half of the diagram).</p>
