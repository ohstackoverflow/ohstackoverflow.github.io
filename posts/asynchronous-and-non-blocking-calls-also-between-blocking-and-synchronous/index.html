<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In many circumstances they are different names for the same thing, but in some
contexts they are quite different. So it depends. Terminology is not applied
in a totally consistent way across the whole software industry.</p>
<p>For example in the classic sockets API, a non-blocking socket is one that
simply returns immediately with a special "would block" error message, whereas
a blocking socket would have blocked. You have to use a separate function such
as <code>select</code> or <code>poll</code> to find out when is a good time to retry.</p>
<p>But asynchronous sockets (as supported by Windows sockets), or the
asynchronous IO pattern used in .NET, are more convenient. You call a method
to start an operation, and the framework calls you back when it's done. Even
here, there are basic differences. Asynchronous Win32 sockets "marshal" their
results onto a specific GUI thread by passing Window messages, whereas .NET
asynchronous IO is free-threaded (you don't know what thread your callback
will be called on).</p>
<p>So <em><strong>they don't always mean the same thing</strong></em>. To distil the socket example,
we could say:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Blocking and synchronous</strong> mean the same thing: you call the API, it <em>hangs up the thread until it has some kind of answer</em> and returns it to you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Non-blocking</strong> means that if an answer can't be returned rapidly, the API <em>returns immediately</em> with an error and does nothing else. So there <em>must be some related way to query whether the API is ready to be called</em> (that is, to simulate a wait in an efficient way, to avoid manual polling in a tight loop).</li>
<li>
<strong>Asynchronous</strong> means that the API <em>always returns immediately,</em> having started a <em>"background" effort</em> to fulfil your request, so there must be some related way to obtain the result.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>synchronous / asynchronous is to describe the relation between two modules.<br>
blocking / non-blocking is to describe the situation of one module.  </p>
<p>An example:<br>
Module X: "I".<br>
Module Y: "bookstore".<br>
X asks Y: do you have a book named "c++ primer"?  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>blocking: before Y answers X, X keeps waiting there for the answer. Now X (one module) is blocking. X and Y are two threads or two processes or one thread or one process? we DON'T know.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-blocking: before Y answers X, X just leaves there and do other things. <strong>X may come back every two minutes to check if Y has finished its job? Or X won't come back until Y calls him? We don't know.</strong> We only know that X can do other things before Y finishes its job. Here X (one module) is non-blocking. X and Y are two threads or two processes or one process? we DON'T know. BUT we are sure that X and Y couldn't be one thread.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>synchronous: before Y answers X, X keeps waiting there for the answer. It means that X can't continue until Y finishes its job. Now we say: X and Y (two modules) are synchronous. X and Y are two threads or two processes or one thread or one process? we DON'T know.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asynchronous: before Y answers X, X leaves there and X can do other jobs. <strong>X won't come back until Y calls him.</strong> Now we say: X and Y (two modules) are asynchronous. X and Y are two threads or two processes or one process? we DON'T know. BUT we are sure that X and Y couldn't be one thread.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please pay attention on the two bold-sentences above. Why does the bold-
sentence in the 2) contain two cases whereas the bold-sentence in the 4)
contains only one case? This is a key of the difference between non-blocking
and asynchronous.</p>
<p>Let me try to explain the four words with another way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>blocking: OMG, I'm frozen! I can't move! I have to wait for that specific event to happen. If that happens, I would be saved!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-blocking: I was told that I had to wait for that specific event to happen. OK, I understand and I promise that I would wait for that. But while waiting, I can still do some other things, I'm not frozen, I'm still alive, I can jump, I can walk, I can sing a song etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>synchronous: My mom is gonna cook, she sends me to buy some meat. I just said to my mom: We are synchronous! I'm so sorry but you have to wait even if I might need 100 years to get some meat back...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asynchronous: We will make a pizza, we need tomato and cheeze. Now I say: Let's go shopping. I'll buy some tomatoes and you will buy some cheeze. We needn't wait for each other because we are asynchronous.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a typical example about non-blocking &amp; synchronous:  </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">// thread X</span>
<span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">true</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">not</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">empty</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">else</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nb">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2000</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// 2 sec</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// thread Y</span>
<span class="c1">// prepare the book for X</span>
<span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can see that this design is non-blocking (you can say that most of time
this loop does something nonsense but in CPU's eyes, X is running, which means
that X is non-blocking. If you want you can replace <code>sleep(2000)</code> with any
other code) whereas X and Y ( <strong>two modules</strong> ) are synchronous because X
can't continue to do any other things (X can't jump out of the loop) until it
gets the book from Y.<br>
Normally in this case, making X blocking is much better because non-blocking
spends much resource for a stupid loop. But this example is good to help you
understand the fact: non-blocking doesn't mean asynchronous.</p>
<p>The four words do make us confused easily, what we should remember is that the
four words serve for the design of architecture. Learning about how to design
a good architecture is the only way to distinguish them.</p>
<p>For example, we may design such a kind of architecture:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">// Module X = Module X1 + Module X2</span>
<span class="c1">// Module X1</span>
<span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">recv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">many_other_modules</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">NON_BLOCKING_FLAG</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">not</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">null</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">"done"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">            </span><span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="c1">// create a thread to process msg</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">else</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nb">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2000</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// 2 sec</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1">// Module X2</span>
<span class="n">broadcast</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I got the book from Y"</span><span class="p">);</span>


<span class="c1">// Module Y</span>
<span class="c1">// prepare the book for X</span>
<span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In the example here, we can say that  </p>
<ul>
<li>X1 is non-blocking</li>
<li>X1 and X2 are synchronous</li>
<li>X and Y are asynchronous</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need, you can also describe those threads created in X1 with the four
words.</p>
<p>One more time: <strong>the four words serve for the design of architecture</strong>. So
what we need is to make a proper architecture, instead of distinguishing the
four words like a language lawyer. If you get some cases, where you can't
distinguish the four words very clearly, you should forget about the four
words, use your own words to describe your architecture.</p>
<p>So the more important things are: when do we use synchronous instead of
asynchronous? when do we use blocking instead of non-blocking? Is making X1
blocking better than non-blocking? Is making X and Y synchronous better than
asynchronous? Why is Nginx non-blocking? Why is Apache blocking? These
questions are what you must figure out.</p>
<p>To make a good choice, you must analyze your need and test the performance of
different architectures. There is no such an architecture that is suitable for
various of needs.</p>
