    <p>I am really interested in how MySQL indexes work, more specifically, how can
they return the data requested without scanning the entire table?</p>
<p>It's off-topic, I know, but if there is someone who could explain this to me
in detail, I would be very, very thankful.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Basically an index on a table works like an index in a book (that's where the
name came from):</p>
<p>Let's say you have a book about databases and you want to find some
information about, say, storage. Without an index (assuming no other aid, such
as a table of contents) you'd have to go through the pages one by one, until
you found the topic (that's a <code>full table scan</code>). On the other hand, an index
has a list of keywords, so you'd consult the index and see that <code>storage</code> is
mentioned on pages 113-120,231 and 354. Then you could flip to those pages
directly, without searching (that's a search with an index, somewhat faster).</p>
<p>Of course, how useful the index will be, depends on many things - a few
examples, using the simile above:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you had a book on databases and indexed the word "database", you'd see that it's mentioned on pages 1-59,61-290, and 292 to 400. In such case, the index is not much help and it might be faster to go through the pages one by one (in a database, this is "poor selectivity").</li>
<li>For a 10-page book, it makes no sense to make an index, as you may end up with a 10-page book prefixed by a 5-page index, which is just silly - just scan the 10 pages and be done with it.</li>
<li>The index also needs to be useful - there's generally no point to index e.g. the frequency of the letter "L" per page.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The first thing you must know is that indexes are a way to avoid scanning the
full table to obtain the result that you're looking for.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of indexes and they're implemented in the storage
layer, so there's no standard between them and they also depend on the storage
engine that you're using.</p>
<h3>InnoDB and the B+Tree index</h3>
<p>For InnoDB, the most common index type is the B+Tree based index, that stores
the elements in a sorted order. Also, you don't have to access the real table
to get the indexed values, which makes your query return way faster.</p>
<p>The "problem" about this index type is that you have to query for the leftmost
value to use the index. So, if your index has two columns, say last_name and
first_name, the order that you query these fields <strong>matters a lot</strong>.</p>
<p>So, given the following table:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">CREATE TABLE person (
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    INDEX (last_name, first_name)
);
</pre></div>

<p>This query would take advantage of the index:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">SELECT last_name, first_name FROM person
WHERE last_name = "John" AND first_name LIKE "J%"
</pre></div>

<p>But the following one would not</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">SELECT last_name, first_name FROM person WHERE first_name = "Constantine"
</pre></div>

<p>Because you're querying the <code>first_name</code> column first and it's not the
leftmost column in the index.</p>
<p>This last example is even worse:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">SELECT last_name, first_name FROM person WHERE first_name LIKE "%Constantine"
</pre></div>

<p>Because now, you're comparing the rightmost part of the rightmost field in the
index.</p>
<h3>The hash index</h3>
<p>This is a different index type that unfortunately, only the memory backend
supports. It's lightning fast but only useful for full lookups, which means
that you can't use it for operations like <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code> or <code>LIKE</code>.</p>
<p>Since it only works for the memory backend, you probably won't use it very
often. The main case I can think of right now is the one that you create a
temporary table in the memory with a set of results from another select and
perform a lot of other selects in this temporary table using hash indexes.</p>
<p>If you have a big <code>VARCHAR</code> field, you can "emulate" the use of a hash index
when using a B-Tree, by creating another column and saving a hash of the big
value on it. Let's say you're storing a url in a field and the values are
quite big. You could also create an integer field called <code>url_hash</code> and use a
hash function like <code>CRC32</code> or any other hash function to hash the url when
inserting it. And then, when you need to query for this value, you can do
something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url_table</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url_hash</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">CRC32</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"http://gnu.org"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The problem with the above example is that since the <code>CRC32</code> function
generates a quite small hash, you'll end up with a lot of collisions in the
hashed values. If you need exact values, you can fix this problem by doing the
following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url_table</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="nt">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url_hash</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">CRC32</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"http://gnu.org"</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">AND</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"http://gnu.org"</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It's still worth to hash things even if the collision number is high cause
you'll only perform the second comparison (the string one) against the
repeated hashes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using this technique, you still need to hit the table to
compare the <code>url</code> field.</p>
<h3>Wrap up</h3>
<p>Some facts that you may consider every time you want to talk about
optimization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Integer comparison is way faster than string comparison. It can be illustrated with the example about the emulation of the hash index in <code>InnoDB</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe, adding additional steps in a process makes it faster, not slower. It can be illustrated by the fact that you can optimize a <code>SELECT</code> by splitting it into two steps, making the first one store values in a newly created in-memory table, and then execute the heavier queries on this second table.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MySQL has other indexes too, but I think the B+Tree one is the most used ever
and the hash one is a good thing to know, but you can find the other ones in
the MySQL documentation.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you to read the "High Performance MySQL" book, the answer
above was definitely based on its chapter about indexes.</p>
