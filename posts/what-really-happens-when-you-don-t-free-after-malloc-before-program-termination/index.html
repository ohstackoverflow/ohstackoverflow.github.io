    <p>We are all taught that you MUST free every pointer that is allocated. I'm a
bit curious, though, about the real cost of not freeing memory. In some
obvious cases, like when <code>malloc()</code> is called inside a loop or part of a
thread execution, it's very important to free so there are no memory leaks.
But consider the following two examples:</p>
<p>First, if I have code that's something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">main</span><span class="ss">()</span>
{
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">char</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">malloc</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="cm">/* Do some arbitrary stuff with 'a' (no alloc functions) */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>What's the real result here? My thinking is that the process dies and then the
heap space is gone anyway so there's no harm in missing the call to <code>free</code>
(however, I do recognize the importance of having it anyway for closure,
maintainability, and good practice). Am I right in this thinking?</p>
<p>Second, let's say I have a program that acts a bit like a shell. Users can
declare variables like <code>aaa = 123</code> and those are stored in some dynamic data
structure for later use. Clearly, it seems obvious that you'd use some
solution that will calls some *alloc function (hashmap, linked list, something
like that). For this kind of program, it doesn't make sense to ever free after
calling <code>malloc</code> because these variables must be present at all times during
the program's execution and there's no good way (that I can see) to implement
this with statically allocated space. Is it bad design to have a bunch of
memory that's allocated but only freed as part of the process ending? If so,
what's the alternative?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Just about every modern operating system will recover all the allocated memory
space after a program exits. The only exception I can think of might be
something like Palm OS where the program's static storage and runtime memory
are pretty much the same thing, so not freeing might cause the program to take
up more storage. (I'm only speculating here.)</p>
<p>So generally, there's no harm in it, except the runtime cost of having more
storage than you need. Certainly in the example you give, you want to keep the
memory for a variable that might be used until it's cleared.</p>
<p>However, it's considered good style to free memory as soon as you don't need
it any more, and to free anything you still have around on program exit. It's
more of an exercise in knowing what memory you're using, and thinking about
whether you still need it. If you don't keep track, you might have memory
leaks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the similar admonition to close your files on exit has a
much more concrete result - if you don't, the data you wrote to them might not
get flushed, or if they're a temp file, they might not get deleted when you're
done. Also, database handles should have their transactions committed and then
closed when you're done with them. Similarly, if you're using an object
oriented language like C++ or Objective C, not freeing an object when you're
done with it will mean the destructor will never get called, and any resources
the class is responsible might not get cleaned up.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Yes you are right, your example doesn't do any harm (at least not on most
modern operating systems). All the memory allocated by your process will be
recovered by the operating system once the process exits.</p>
<p>Source: Allocation and GC Myths (PostScript alert!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allocation Myth 4: Non-garbage-collected programs should always deallocate
all memory they allocate.</p>
<p>The Truth: Omitted deallocations in frequently executed code cause growing
leaks. They are rarely acceptable. but Programs that retain most allocated
memory until program exit often perform better without any intervening
deallocation. Malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free.</p>
<p>In most cases, <strong>deallocating memory just before program exit is
pointless.</strong> The OS will reclaim it anyway. Free will touch and page in the
dead objects; the OS won't.</p>
<p>Consequence: Be careful with "leak detectors" that count allocations. Some
"leaks" are good!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, you should really try to avoid all memory leaks!</p>
<p>Second question: your design is ok. If you need to store something until your
application exits then its ok to do this with dynamic memory allocation. If
you don't know the required size upfront, you can't use statically allocated
memory.</p>
