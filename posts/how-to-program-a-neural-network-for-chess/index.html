    <p>I want to program a chess engine which learns to make good moves and win
against other players. I've already coded a representation of the chess board
and a function which outputs all possible moves. So I only need an evaluation
function which says how good a given situation of the board is. Therefore, I
would like to use an artificial neural network which should then evaluate a
given position. The output should be a numerical value. The higher the value
is, the better is the position for the white player.</p>
<p>My approach is to build a network of 385 neurons: There are six unique chess
pieces and 64 fields on the board. So for every field we take 6 neurons (1 for
every piece). If there is a white piece, the input value is 1. If there is a
black piece, the value is -1. And if there is no piece of that sort on that
field, the value is 0. In addition to that there should be 1 neuron for the
player to move. If it is White's turn, the input value is 1 and if it's
Black's turn, the value is -1.</p>
<p>I think that configuration of the neural network is quite good. But the main
part is missing: How can I implement this neural network into a coding
language (e.g. Delphi)? I think the weights for each neuron should be the same
in the beginning. Depending on the result of a match, the weights should then
be adjusted. But how? I think I should let 2 computer players (both using my
engine) play against each other. If White wins, Black gets the feedback that
its weights aren't good.</p>
<p>So it would be great if you could help me implementing the neural network into
a coding language (best would be Delphi, otherwise pseudo-code). Thanks in
advance!</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Been there, done that. Since there is no continuity in your problem (the value
of a position is not closely related to an other position with only 1 change
in the value of one input), there is very little chance a NN would work. And
it never did in my experiments.</p>
<p>I would rather see a simulated annealing system with an ad-hoc heuristic (of
which there are plenty out there) to evaluate the value of the position...</p>
<p>However, if you are set on using a NN, is is relatively easy to represent. A
general NN is simply a graph, with each node being a neuron. Each neuron has a
current activation value, and a transition formula to compute the next
activation value, based on input values, i.e. activation values of all the
nodes that have a link to it.</p>
<p>A more classical NN, that is with an input layer, an output layer, identical
neurons for each layer, and no time-dependency, can thus be represented by an
array of input nodes, an array of output nodes, and a linked graph of nodes
connecting those. Each node possesses a current activation value, and a list
of nodes it forwards to. Computing the output value is simply setting the
activations of the input neurons to the input values, and iterating through
each subsequent layer in turn, computing the activation values from the
previous layer using the transition formula. When you have reached the last
(output) layer, you have your result.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I don't see why you can't have a neural net for a static evaluator if you also
do some classic mini-max lookahead with alpha-beta pruning. Lots of Chess
engines use minimax with a braindead static evaluator that just adds up the
pieces or something; it doesn't matter so much if you have enough levels of
minimax. I don't know how much of an improvement the net would make but
there's little to lose. Training it would be tricky though. I'd suggest using
an engine that looks ahead many moves (and takes loads of CPU etc) to train
the evaluator for an engine that looks ahead fewer moves. That way you end up
with an engine that doesn't take as much CPU (hopefully).</p>
<p>Edit: I wrote the above in 2010, and now in 2020 Stockfish NNUE has done it.
"The network is optimized and trained on the [classical Stockfish] evaluations
of millions of positions at moderate search depth" and then used as a static
evaluator, and in their initial tests they got an 80-elo improvement when
using this static evaluator instead of their previous one (or, equivalently,
the same elo with a little less CPU time). So yes it does work, and you don't
even have to train the network at high search depth as I originally suggested:
moderate search depth is enough, but the key is to use many millions of
positions.</p>
