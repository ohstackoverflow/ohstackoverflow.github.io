    <p>Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A created repository:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">mkdir GitTest2
</pre></div>

<p>cd GitTest2
git init</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some modifications in the master take place and get committed:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">echo "On Master" &gt; file
</pre></div>

<p>git commit -a -m "Initial commit"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git branch feature1
</pre></div>

<p>git checkout feature1
echo "Feature1" &gt; featureFile
git commit -a -m "Commit for feature1"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout master
</pre></div>

<p>git branch hotfix1
git checkout hotfix1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bug is fixed in the hotfix branch and merged back into the master (perhaps after a pull request/code review):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">echo "Bugfix" &gt; bugfixFile
</pre></div>

<p>git commit -a -m "Bugfix Commit"
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development on feature1 continues:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout feature1
</pre></div>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Say I need the hotfix in my feature branch, maybe because the bug also occurs
there. How can I achieve this without duplicating the commits into my feature
branch?</p>
<p>I want to prevent to get two new commits on my feature branch which have no
relation to the feature implementation. This especially seems important for me
if I use pull requests: All these commits will also be included in the pull
request and have to be reviewed although this has already been done (as the
hotfix is already in the master).</p>
<p>I can not do a <code>git merge master --ff-only</code>: "fatal: Not possible to fast-
forward, aborting.", but I am not sure if this helped me.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>How do we merge the master branch into the feature branch? Easy:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout feature1
git merge master
</pre></div>

<p>There is no point in forcing a fast forward merge here, as it cannot be done.
You committed both into the feature branch and the master branch. Fast forward
is impossible now.</p>
<p>Have a look at GitFlow. It is a branching model for git that can be followed,
and you unconsciously already did. It also is an extension to Git which adds
some commands for the new workflow steps that do things automatically which
you would otherwise need to do manually.</p>
<p>So what did you do right in your workflow? You have two branches to work with,
your feature1 branch is basically the "develop" branch in the GitFlow model.</p>
<p>You created a hotfix branch from master and merged it back. And now you are
stuck.</p>
<p>The GitFlow model asks you to merge the hotfix also to the development branch,
which is "feature1" in your case.</p>
<p>So the real answer would be:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout feature1
git merge --no-ff hotfix1
</pre></div>

<p>This adds all the changes that were made inside the hotfix to the feature
branch, but <em>only</em> those changes. They might conflict with other development
changes in the branch, but they will not conflict with the master branch
should you merge the feature branch back to master eventually.</p>
<p>Be very careful with rebasing. Only rebase if the changes you did stayed local
to your repository, e.g. you did not push any branches to some other
repository. Rebasing is a great tool for you to arrange your local commits
into a useful order before pushing it out into the world, but rebasing
afterwards will mess up things for the git beginners like you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You should be able to rebase your branch on master:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout feature1
git rebase master
</pre></div>

<p>Manage all conflicts that arise. When you get to the commits with the bugfixes
(already in master), Git will say that there were no changes and that maybe
they were already applied. You then continue the rebase (while skipping the
commits already in master) with</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git rebase --skip
</pre></div>

<p>If you perform a <code>git log</code> on your feature branch, you'll see the bugfix
commit appear only once, and in the master portion.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion, take a look at the Git book documentation on
<code>git rebase</code> (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) which cover this exact use
case.</p>
<p>================ Edit for additional context ====================</p>
<p>This answer was provided specifically for the question asked by @theomega,
taking his particular situation into account. Note this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to prevent [...] commits on my feature branch which have no relation
to the feature implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebasing his private branch on master is exactly what will yield that result.
In contrast, merging master into his branch would precisely do what he
<strong><em>specifically does not want to happen</em></strong> : adding a commit that is not
related to the feature implementation he is working on via his branch.</p>
<p>To address the users that read the question title, skip over the actual
content and context of the question, and then only read the top answer blindly
assuming it will always apply to their (different) use case, allow me to
elaborate:</p>
<ul>
<li>only rebase private branches (i.e. that only exist in your local repository and haven't been shared with others). Rebasing shared branches would "break" the copies other people may have.</li>
<li>if you want to integrate changes from a branch (whether it's master or another branch) into a branch that is public (e.g. you've pushed the branch to open a pull request, but there are now conflicts with master, and you need to update your branch to resolve those conflicts) you'll need to merge them in (e.g. with <code>git merge master</code> as in @Sven's answer).</li>
<li>you can also merge branches into your local private branches if that's your preference, but be aware that it will result in "foreign" commits in your branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you're unhappy with the fact that this answer is not the best fit
for your situation even though it was for @theomega, adding a comment below
won't be particularly helpful: I don't control which answer is selected, only
@theomega does.</p>
