<p>When looking beyond the RAD (drag-drop and configure) way of building user
interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three
design patterns called Model-View-Controller, Model-View-Presenter and Model-
View-ViewModel. My question has three parts to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>What issues do these patterns address?</li>
<li>How are they similar?</li>
<li>How are they different?</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h3>Model-View-Presenter</h3>
<p>In <strong>MVP</strong> , the Presenter contains the UI business logic for the View. All
invocations from the View delegate directly to the Presenter. The Presenter is
also decoupled directly from the View and talks to it through an interface.
This is to allow mocking of the View in a unit test. One common attribute of
MVP is that there has to be a lot of two-way dispatching. For example, when
someone clicks the "Save" button, the event handler delegates to the
Presenter's "OnSave" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will
then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display
that the save has completed.</p>
<p>MVP tends to be a very natural pattern for achieving separated presentation in
WebForms. The reason is that the View is always created first by the ASP.NET
runtime. You can find out more about both variants.</p>
<h4>Two primary variations</h4>
<p><strong>Passive View:</strong> The View is as dumb as possible and contains almost zero
logic. A Presenter is a middle man that talks to the View and the Model. The
View and Model are completely shielded from one another. The Model may raise
events, but the Presenter subscribes to them for updating the View. In Passive
View there is no direct data binding, instead, the View exposes setter
properties that the Presenter uses to set the data. All state is managed in
the Presenter and not the View.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: maximum testability surface; clean separation of the View and Model</li>
<li>Con: more work (for example all the setter properties) as you are doing all the data binding yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supervising Controller:</strong> The Presenter handles user gestures. The View
binds to the Model directly through data binding. In this case, it's the
Presenter's job to pass off the Model to the View so that it can bind to it.
The Presenter will also contain logic for gestures like pressing a button,
navigation, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: by leveraging data binding the amount of code is reduced.</li>
<li>Con: there's a less testable surface (because of data binding), and there's less encapsulation in the View since it talks directly to the Model.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model-View-Controller</h3>
<p>In the <strong>MVC</strong> , the Controller is responsible for determining which View to
display in response to any action including when the application loads. This
differs from MVP where actions route through the View to the Presenter. In
MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along
with an action. In the web, each action involves a call to a URL on the other
side of which there is a Controller who responds. Once that Controller has
completed its processing, it will return the correct View. The sequence
continues in that manner throughout the life of the application:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">View</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Controller</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Controller</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Logic</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Controller</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">returns</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">View</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>

<p>One other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to
the Model. The view simply renders and is completely stateless. In
implementations of MVC, the View usually will not have any logic in the code
behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary because, if
the View does not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called.</p>
<h3>Presentation Model</h3>
<p>One other pattern to look at is the <strong>Presentation Model</strong> pattern. In this
pattern, there is no Presenter. Instead, the View binds directly to a
Presentation Model. The Presentation Model is a Model crafted specifically for
the View. This means this Model can expose properties that one would never put
on a domain model as it would be a violation of separation-of-concerns. In
this case, the Presentation Model binds to the domain model and may subscribe
to events coming from that Model. The View then subscribes to events coming
from the Presentation Model and updates itself accordingly. The Presentation
Model can expose commands which the view uses for invoking actions. The
advantage of this approach is that you can essentially remove the code-behind
altogether as the PM completely encapsulates all of the behavior for the view.
This pattern is a very strong candidate for use in WPF applications and is
also called Model-View-ViewModel.</p>
<p>There is a MSDN article about the Presentation Model and a section in the
Composite Application Guidance for WPF (former Prism) about Separated
Presentation Patterns</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>This is an oversimplification of the many variants of these design patterns,
but this is how I like to think about the differences between the two.</p>
