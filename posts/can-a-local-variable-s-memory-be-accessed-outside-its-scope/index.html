<p>The output was <code>58</code></p>
<p>How can it be? Isn't the memory of a local variable inaccessible outside its
function?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How can it be? Isn't the memory of a local variable inaccessible outside its
function?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You rent a hotel room. You put a book in the top drawer of the bedside table
and go to sleep. You check out the next morning, but "forget" to give back
your key. You steal the key!</p>
<p>A week later, you return to the hotel, do not check in, sneak into your old
room with your stolen key, and look in the drawer. Your book is still there.
Astonishing!</p>
<p><strong>How can that be? Aren't the contents of a hotel room drawer inaccessible if
you haven't rented the room?</strong></p>
<p>Well, obviously that scenario can happen in the real world no problem. There
is no mysterious force that causes your book to disappear when you are no
longer authorized to be in the room. Nor is there a mysterious force that
prevents you from entering a room with a stolen key.</p>
<p>The hotel management is not <em>required</em> to remove your book. You didn't make a
contract with them that said that if you leave stuff behind, they'll shred it
for you. If you illegally re-enter your room with a stolen key to get it back,
the hotel security staff is not <em>required</em> to catch you sneaking in. You
didn't make a contract with them that said "if I try to sneak back into my
room later, you are required to stop me." Rather, you signed a contract with
them that said "I promise not to sneak back into my room later", a contract
which <em>you broke</em>.</p>
<p>In this situation <strong>anything can happen</strong>. The book can be there—you got
lucky. Someone else's book can be there and yours could be in the hotel's
furnace. Someone could be there right when you come in, tearing your book to
pieces. The hotel could have removed the table and book entirely and replaced
it with a wardrobe. The entire hotel could be just about to be torn down and
replaced with a football stadium, and you are going to die in an explosion
while you are sneaking around.</p>
<p>You don't know what is going to happen; when you checked out of the hotel and
stole a key to illegally use later, you gave up the right to live in a
predictable, safe world because <em>you</em> chose to break the rules of the system.</p>
<p><strong>C++ is not a safe language</strong>. It will cheerfully allow you to break the
rules of the system. If you try to do something illegal and foolish like going
back into a room you're not authorized to be in and rummaging through a desk
that might not even be there anymore, C++ is not going to stop you. Safer
languages than C++ solve this problem by restricting your power—by having much
stricter control over keys, for example.</p>
<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>Holy goodness, this answer is getting a lot of attention. (I'm not sure why—I
considered it to be just a "fun" little analogy, but whatever.)</p>
<p>I thought it might be germane to update this a bit with a few more technical
thoughts.</p>
<p>Compilers are in the business of generating code which manages the storage of
the data manipulated by that program. There are lots of different ways of
generating code to manage memory, but over time two basic techniques have
become entrenched.</p>
<p>The first is to have some sort of "long lived" storage area where the
"lifetime" of each byte in the storage—that is, the period of time when it is
validly associated with some program variable—cannot be easily predicted ahead
of time. The compiler generates calls into a "heap manager" that knows how to
dynamically allocate storage when it is needed and reclaim it when it is no
longer needed.</p>
<p>The second method is to have a “short-lived” storage area where the lifetime
of each byte is well known. Here, the lifetimes follow a “nesting” pattern.
The longest-lived of these short-lived variables will be allocated before any
other short-lived variables, and will be freed last. Shorter-lived variables
will be allocated after the longest-lived ones, and will be freed before them.
The lifetime of these shorter-lived variables is “nested” within the lifetime
of longer-lived ones.</p>
<p>Local variables follow the latter pattern; when a method is entered, its local
variables come alive. When that method calls another method, the new method's
local variables come alive. They'll be dead before the first method's local
variables are dead. The relative order of the beginnings and endings of
lifetimes of storages associated with local variables can be worked out ahead
of time.</p>
<p>For this reason, local variables are usually generated as storage on a "stack"
data structure, because a stack has the property that the first thing pushed
on it is going to be the last thing popped off.</p>
<p>It's like the hotel decides to only rent out rooms sequentially, and you can't
check out until everyone with a room number higher than you has checked out.</p>
<p>So let's think about the stack. In many operating systems you get one stack
per thread and the stack is allocated to be a certain fixed size. When you
call a method, stuff is pushed onto the stack. If you then pass a pointer to
the stack back out of your method, as the original poster does here, that's
just a pointer to the middle of some entirely valid million-byte memory block.
In our analogy, you check out of the hotel; when you do, you just checked out
of the highest-numbered occupied room. If no one else checks in after you, and
you go back to your room illegally, all your stuff is guaranteed to still be
there <em>in this particular hotel</em>.</p>
<p>We use stacks for temporary stores because they are really cheap and easy. An
implementation of C++ is not required to use a stack for storage of locals; it
could use the heap. It doesn't, because that would make the program slower.</p>
<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to leave the garbage you left on the
stack untouched so that you can come back for it later illegally; it is
perfectly legal for the compiler to generate code that turns back to zero
everything in the "room" that you just vacated. It doesn't because again, that
would be expensive.</p>
<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to ensure that when the stack
logically shrinks, the addresses that used to be valid are still mapped into
memory. The implementation is allowed to tell the operating system "we're done
using this page of stack now. Until I say otherwise, issue an exception that
destroys the process if anyone touches the previously-valid stack page".
Again, implementations do not actually do that because it is slow and
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead, implementations let you make mistakes and get away with it. Most of
the time. Until one day something truly awful goes wrong and the process
explodes.</p>
<p>This is problematic. There are a lot of rules and it is very easy to break
them accidentally. I certainly have many times. And worse, the problem often
only surfaces when memory is detected to be corrupt billions of nanoseconds
after the corruption happened, when it is very hard to figure out who messed
it up.</p>
<p>More memory-safe languages solve this problem by restricting your power. In
"normal" C# there simply is no way to take the address of a local and return
it or store it for later. You can take the address of a local, but the
language is cleverly designed so that it is impossible to use it after the
lifetime of the local ends. In order to take the address of a local and pass
it back, you have to put the compiler in a special "unsafe" mode, <em>and</em> put
the word "unsafe" in your program, to call attention to the fact that you are
probably doing something dangerous that could be breaking the rules.</p>

<p><em>Memory management</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You're are simply reading and writing to memory that <em>used to</em> be the address
of <code>a</code>. Now that you're outside of <code>foo</code>, it's just a pointer to some random
memory area. It just so happens that in your example, that memory area does
exist and nothing else is using it at the moment.</p>
<p>You don't break anything by continuing to use it, and nothing else has
overwritten it yet. Therefore, the <code>5</code> is still there. In a real program, that
memory would be reused almost immediately and you'd break something by doing
this (though the symptoms may not appear until much later!).</p>
<p>When you return from <code>foo</code>, you tell the OS that you're no longer using that
memory and it can be reassigned to something else. If you're lucky and it
never does get reassigned, and the OS doesn't catch you using it again, then
you'll get away with the lie. Chances are though you'll end up writing over
whatever else ends up with that address.</p>
<p>Now if you're wondering why the compiler doesn't complain, it's probably
because <code>foo</code> got eliminated by optimization. It usually will warn you about
this sort of thing. C assumes you know what you're doing though, and
technically you haven't violated scope here (there's no reference to <code>a</code>
itself outside of <code>foo</code>), only memory access rules, which only triggers a
warning rather than an error.</p>
<p>In short: this won't usually work, but sometimes will by chance.</p>
