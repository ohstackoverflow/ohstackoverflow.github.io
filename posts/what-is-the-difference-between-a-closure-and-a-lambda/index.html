<p>And now that we're here, how do they differ from a regular function?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A <strong>lambda</strong> is just an anonymous function - a function defined with no name.
In some languages, such as Scheme, they are equivalent to named functions. In
fact, the function definition is re-written as binding a lambda to a variable
internally. In other languages, like Python, there are some (rather needless)
distinctions between them, but they behave the same way otherwise.</p>
<p>A <strong>closure</strong> is any function which <strong>closes over</strong> the <strong>environment</strong> in
which it was defined. This means that it can access variables not in its
parameter list. Examples:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">func</span><span class="ss">()</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">h</span>
<span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">anotherfunc</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">h</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
<span class="w">   </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">func</span><span class="ss">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will cause an error, because <code>func</code> does not <strong>close over</strong> the
environment in <code>anotherfunc</code> - <code>h</code> is undefined. <code>func</code> only closes over the
global environment. This will work:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">anotherfunc</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">h</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">func</span><span class="ss">()</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">h</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">func</span><span class="ss">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Because here, <code>func</code> is defined in <code>anotherfunc</code>, and in python 2.3 and
greater (or some number like this) when they <em>almost</em> got closures correct
(mutation still doesn't work), this means that it <strong>closes over</strong>
<code>anotherfunc</code>'s environment and can access variables inside of it. In Python
3.1+, mutation works too when using the <code>nonlocal</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Another important point - <code>func</code> will continue to close over <code>anotherfunc</code>'s
environment even when it's no longer being evaluated in <code>anotherfunc</code>. This
code will also work:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">anotherfunc</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">h</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">func</span><span class="ss">()</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">h</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">func</span>

<span class="nv">print</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">anotherfunc</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="ss">)()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will print 10.</p>
<p>This, as you notice, has nothing to do with <strong>lambda</strong> s - they are two
different (although related) concepts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There is a lot of confusion around lambdas and closures, even in the answers
to this StackOverflow question here. Instead of asking random programmers who
learned about closures from practice with certain programming languages or
other clueless programmers, take a journey to the <em>source</em> (where it all
began). And since lambdas and closures come from <strong>Lambda Calculus</strong> invented
by Alonzo Church back in the '30s before first electronic computers even
existed, this is the <em>source</em> I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Lambda Calculus is the simplest programming language in the world. The only
things you can do in it:►</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>APPLICATION: Applying one expression to another, denoted <code>f x</code>.<br>
(Think of it as a <em>function call</em> , where <code>f</code> is the function and <code>x</code> is its
only parameter)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ABSTRACTION: Binds a symbol occurring in an expression to mark that this symbol is just a "slot", a blank box waiting to be filled with value, a "variable" as it were. It is done by prepending a Greek letter <code>λ</code> (lambda), then the symbolic name (e.g. <code>x</code>), then a dot <code>.</code> before the expression. This then converts the expression into a <em>function</em> expecting one <em>parameter</em>.<br>
For example: <code>λx.x+2</code> takes the expression <code>x+2</code> and tells that the symbol <code>x</code>
in this expression is a <em>bound variable</em> – it can be substituted with a value
you supply as a parameter.<br>
Note that the function defined this way is <em>anonymous</em> – it doesn't have a
name, so you can't refer to it yet, but you can <em>immediately call</em> it
(remember application?) by supplying it the parameter it is waiting for, like
this: <code>(λx.x+2) 7</code>. Then the expression (in this case a literal value) <code>7</code> is
substituted as <code>x</code> in the subexpression <code>x+2</code> of the applied lambda, so you
get <code>7+2</code>, which then reduces to <code>9</code> by common arithmetics rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we've solved one of the mysteries:<br><strong>lambda</strong> is the <em>anonymous function</em> from the example above, <code>λx.x+2</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In different programming languages, the syntax for functional abstraction
(lambda) may differ. For example, in JavaScript it looks like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">function</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="c1">; }</span>
</pre></div>

<p>and you can immediately apply it to some parameter like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">function</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="c1">; })(7)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>or you can store this anonymous function (lambda) into some variable:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">f</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>which effectively gives it a name <code>f</code>, allowing you to refer to it and call it
multiple times later, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">alert(  f(7) + f(10)  );   // should print 21 in the message box
</pre></div>

<p>But you didn't have to name it. You could call it immediately:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">alert</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">function</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="c1">; } (7)  );  // should print 9 in the message box</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In LISP, lambdas are made like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">(lambda (x) (+ x 2))
</pre></div>

<p>and you can call such a lambda by applying it immediately to a parameter:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">(  (lambda (x) (+ x 2))  7  )
</pre></div>

<hr>
<p>OK, now it's time to solve the other mystery: what is a <em>closure</em>. In order to
do that, let's talk about <em>symbols</em> ( <em>variables</em> ) in lambda expressions.</p>
<p>As I said, what the lambda abstraction does is <em>binding</em> a symbol in its
subexpression, so that it becomes a substitutible <em>parameter</em>. Such a symbol
is called <em>bound</em>. But what if there are other symbols in the expression? For
example: <code>λx.x/y+2</code>. In this expression, the symbol <code>x</code> is bound by the lambda
abstraction <code>λx.</code> preceding it. But the other symbol, <code>y</code>, is not bound – it
is <em>free</em>. We don't know what it is and where it comes from, so we don't know
what it <em>means</em> and what <em>value</em> it represents, and therefore we cannot
evaluate that expression until we figure out what <code>y</code> means.</p>
<p>In fact, the same goes with the other two symbols, <code>2</code> and <code>+</code>. It's just that
we are so familiar with these two symbols that we usually forget that the
computer doesn't know them and we need to tell it what they mean by defining
them somewhere, e.g. in a library or the language itself.</p>
<p>You can think of the <em>free</em> symbols as defined somewhere else, outside the
expression, in its "surrounding context", which is called its <strong>environment</strong>.
The environment might be a bigger expression that this expression is a part of
(as Qui-Gon Jinn said: "There's always a bigger fish" ;) ), or in some
library, or in the language itself (as a <em>primitive</em> ).</p>
<p>This lets us divide lambda expressions into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLOSED expressions: every symbol that occurs in these expressions is <em>bound</em> by some lambda abstraction. In other words, they are <em>self-contained</em> ; they don't require any surrounding context to be evaluated. They are also called <em>combinators</em>.</li>
<li>OPEN expressions: some symbols in these expressions are not <em>bound</em> – that is, some of the symbols occurring in them are <em>free</em> and they require some external information, and thus they cannot be evaluated until you supply the definitions of these symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can CLOSE an <em>open</em> lambda expression by supplying the <strong>environment</strong> ,
which defines all these free symbols by binding them to some values (which may
be numbers, strings, anonymous functions aka lambdas, whatever…).</p>
<p>And here comes the <em>closure</em> part:<br>
The <strong>closure</strong> of a <em>lambda expression</em> is this particular set of symbols
defined in the outer context (environment) that give values to the <em>free
symbols</em> in this expression, making them non-free anymore. It turns an <em>open</em>
lambda expression, which still contains some "undefined" free symbols, into a
<em>closed</em> one, which doesn't have any free symbols anymore.</p>
<p>For example, if you have the following lambda expression: <code>λx.x/y+2</code>, the
symbol <code>x</code> is bound, while the symbol <code>y</code> is free, therefore the expression is
<code>open</code> and cannot be evaluated unless you say what <code>y</code> means (and the same
with <code>+</code> and <code>2</code>, which are also free). But suppose that you also have an
<em>environment</em> like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{  y: 3,
+: [built-in addition],
2: [built-in number],
q: 42,
w: 5  }
</pre></div>

<p>This <em>environment</em> supplies definitions for all the "undefined" (free) symbols
from our lambda expression (<code>y</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>2</code>), and several extra symbols (<code>q</code>,
<code>w</code>). The symbols that we need to be defined are this subset of the
environment:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{  y: 3,
+: [built-in addition],
2: [built-in number]  }
</pre></div>

<p>and this is precisely the <em>closure</em> of our lambda expression :&gt;</p>
<p>In other words, it <em>closes</em> an open lambda expression. This is where the name
<em>closure</em> came from in the first place, and this is why so many people's
answers in this thread are not quite correct :P</p>
<hr>
<p>So why are they mistaken? Why do so many of them say that closures are some
data structures in memory, or some features of the languages they use, or why
do they confuse closures with lambdas? :P</p>
<p>Well, the corporate marketoids of Sun/Oracle, Microsoft, Google etc. are to
blame, because that's what they called these constructs in their languages
(Java, C#, Go etc.). They often call "closures" what are supposed to be just
lambdas. Or they call "closures" a particular technique they used to implement
lexical scoping, that is, the fact that a function can access the variables
that were defined in its outer scope at the time of its definition. They often
say that the function "encloses" these variables, that is, captures them into
some data structure to save them from being destroyed after the outer function
finishes executing. But this is just made-up <em>post factum</em> "folklore
etymology" and marketing, which only makes things more confusing, because
every language vendor uses its own terminology.</p>
<p>And it's even worse because of the fact that there's always a bit of truth in
what they say, which does not allow you to easily dismiss it as false :P Let
me explain:</p>
<p>If you want to implement a language that uses lambdas as first-class citizens,
you need to allow them to use symbols defined in their surrounding context
(that is, to use free variables in your lambdas). And these symbols must be
there even when the surrounding function returns. The problem is that these
symbols are bound to some local storage of the function (usually on the call
stack), which won't be there anymore when the function returns. Therefore, in
order for a lambda to work the way you expect, you need to somehow "capture"
all these free variables from its outer context and save them for later, even
when the outer context will be gone. That is, you need to find the <em>closure</em>
of your lambda (all these external variables it uses) and store it somewhere
else (either by making a copy, or by preparing space for them upfront,
somewhere else than on the stack). The actual method you use to achieve this
goal is an "implementation detail" of your language. What's important here is
the <em>closure</em> , which is the set of <em>free variables</em> from the <em>environment</em> of
your lambda that need to be saved somewhere.</p>
<p>It didn't took too long for people to start calling the actual data structure
they use in their language's implementations to implement closure as the
"closure" itself. The structure usually looks something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Closure {
   [pointer to the lambda function's machine code],
   [pointer to the lambda function's environment]
}
</pre></div>

<p>and these data structures are being passed around as parameters to other
functions, returned from functions, and stored in variables, to represent
lambdas, and allowing them to access their enclosing environment as well as
the machine code to run in that context. But it's just a way (one of many) to
<em>implement</em> closure, not <em>the</em> closure itself.</p>
<p>As I explained above, the closure of a lambda expression is the subset of
definitions in its environment that give values to the free variables
contained in that lambda expression, effectively <em>closing</em> the expression
(turning an <em>open</em> lambda expression, which cannot be evaluated yet, into a
<em>closed</em> lambda expression, which can then be evaluated, since all the symbols
contained in it are now defined).</p>
<p>Anything else is just a "cargo cult" and "voo-doo magic" of programmers and
language vendors unaware of the real roots of these notions.</p>
<p>I hope that answers your questions. But if you had any follow-up questions,
feel free to ask them in the comments, and I'll try to explain it better.</p>
