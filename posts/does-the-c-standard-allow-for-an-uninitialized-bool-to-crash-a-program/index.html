    <p>I know that an <em>"undefined behaviour"</em> in C++ can pretty much allow the
compiler to do anything it wants. However, I had a crash that surprised me, as
I assumed that the code was safe enough.</p>
<p>In this case, the real problem happened only on a specific platform using a
specific compiler, and only if optimization was enabled.</p>
<p>I tried several things in order to reproduce the problem and simplify it to
the maximum. Here's an extract of a function called <code>Serialize</code>, that would
take a bool parameter, and copy the string <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> to an existing
destination buffer.</p>
<p>Would this function be in a code review, there would be no way to tell that
it, in fact, could crash if the bool parameter was an uninitialized value?</p>

<p>If this code is executed with clang 5.0.0 + optimizations, it will/can crash.</p>
<p>The expected ternary-operator <code>boolValue ? "true" : "false"</code> looked safe
enough for me, I was assuming, "Whatever garbage value is in <code>boolValue</code>
doesn't matter, since it will evaluate to true or false anyhow."</p>
<p>I have setup a Compiler Explorer example that shows the problem in the
disassembly, here the complete example. <em>Note: in order to repro the issue,
the combination I've found that worked is by using Clang 5.0.0 with -O2
optimisation.</em></p>

<p>The problem arises because of the optimizer: It was clever enough to deduce
that the strings "true" and "false" only differs in length by 1. So instead of
really calculating the length, it uses the value of the bool itself, which
<em>should</em> technically be either 0 or 1, and goes like this:</p>

<p>While this is "clever", so to speak, my question is: <strong>Does the C++ standard
allow a compiler to assume a bool can only have an internal numerical
representation of '0' or '1' and use it in such a way?</strong></p>
<p>Or is this a case of implementation-defined, in which case the implementation
assumed that all its bools will only ever contain 0 or 1, and any other value
is undefined behaviour territory?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>Yes, ISO C++ allows (but doesn't require) implementations to make this</h4>
<p>choice.</p>
<p>But also note that ISO C++ allows a compiler to emit code that crashes on
purpose (e.g. with an illegal instruction) if the program encounters UB, e.g.
as a way to help you find errors. (Or because it's a DeathStation 9000. Being
strictly conforming is not sufficient for a C++ implementation to be useful
for any real purpose). <strong>So ISO C++ would allow a compiler to make asm that
crashed (for totally different reasons) even on similar code that read an
uninitialized<code>uint32_t</code>.</strong> Even though that's required to be a fixed-layout
type with no trap representations. (Note that C has different rules from C++;
an uninitialized variable has an <em>indeterminate</em> value in C which might be a
trap representation, but reading one at all is fully UB in C++. Not sure if
there are extra rules for C11 <code>_Bool</code> which could allow the same crash
behaviour as C++.)</p>
<p>It's an interesting question about how real implementations work, but remember
that even if the answer was different, your code would still be unsafe because
modern C++ is not a portable version of assembly language.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You're compiling for the x86-64 System V ABI, which specifies that a<code>bool</code>
as a function arg in a register is represented by the bit-patterns <code>false=0</code>
and <code>true=1</code></strong> in the low 8 bits of the register1. In memory, <code>bool</code> is a
1-byte type that again must have an integer value of 0 or 1.</p>
<p>(An ABI is a set of implementation choices that compilers for the same
platform agree on so they can make code that calls each other's functions,
including type sizes, struct layout rules, and calling conventions.)</p>
<p><strong>ISO C++ doesn't specify it, but this ABI decision is widespread because it
makes bool- &gt;int conversion cheap (just zero-extension)</strong>. I'm not aware of
any ABIs that don't let the compiler assume 0 or 1 for <code>bool</code>, for any
architecture (not just x86). It allows optimizations like <code>!mybool</code> with <code>xor
eax,1</code> to flip the low bit: Any possible code that can flip a bit/integer/bool
between 0 and 1 in single CPU instruction. Or compiling <code>a&amp;&amp;b</code> to a bitwise
AND for <code>bool</code> types. Some compilers do actually take advantage Boolean values
as 8 bit in compilers. Are operations on them inefficient?.</p>
<p><strong>In general, the as-if rule allows allows the compiler to take advantage of
things that are true <em>on the target platform being compiled for</em></strong> , because
the end result will be executable code that implements the same externally-
visible behaviour as the C++ source. (With all the restrictions that Undefined
Behaviour places on what is actually "externally visible": not with a
debugger, but from another thread in a well-formed / legal C++ program.)</p>
<p><strong>The compiler is definitely allowed to take full advantage of an ABI
guarantee in its code-gen, and make code like you found which
optimizes<code>strlen(whichString)</code> to<br><code>5U - boolValue</code>.</strong> (BTW, this optimization is kind of clever, but maybe
shortsighted vs. branching and inlining <code>memcpy</code>as stores of immediate data2.)</p>
<p>Or the compiler could have created a table of pointers and indexed it with the
integer value of the <code>bool</code>, again assuming it was a 0 or 1. (This possibility
is what @Barmar's answer suggested.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Your <code>__attribute((noinline))</code> constructor with optimization enabled led to
clang just loading a byte from the stack to use as <code>uninitializedBool</code>. It
made space for the object in <code>main</code> with <code>push rax</code> (which is smaller and for
various reason about as efficient as <code>sub rsp, 8</code>), so whatever garbage was in
AL on entry to <code>main</code> is the value it used for <code>uninitializedBool</code>. This is
why you actually got values that weren't just <code>0</code>.</p>
<p><code>5U - random garbage</code> can easily wrap to a large unsigned value, leading
memcpy to go into unmapped memory. The destination is in static storage, not
the stack, so you're not overwriting a return address or something.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Other implementations could make different choices, e.g.<code>false=0</code> and
<code>true=any non-zero value</code>. Then clang probably wouldn't make code that crashes
for <em>this</em> specific instance of UB. (But it would still be allowed to if it
wanted to.)</strong> I don't know of any implementations that choose anything other
what x86-64 does for <code>bool</code>, but the C++ standard allows many things that
nobody does or even would want to do on hardware that's anything like current
CPUs.</p>
<p><strong>ISO C++ leaves it unspecified what you'll find when you examine or modify
the object representation of a<code>bool</code></strong>. (e.g. by <code>memcpy</code>ing the <code>bool</code> into
<code>unsigned char</code>, which you're allowed to do because <code>char*</code> can alias
anything. And <code>unsigned char</code> is guaranteed to have no padding bits, so the
C++ standard does formally let you hexdump object representations without any
UB. Pointer-casting to copy the object representation is different from
assigning <code>char foo = my_bool</code>, of course, so booleanization to 0 or 1
wouldn't happen and you'd get the raw object representation.)</p>
<p><strong>You've <em>partially</em> "hidden" the UB on this execution path from the compiler
with <code>noinline</code></strong>. Even if it doesn't inline, though, interprocedural
optimizations could still make a version of the function that depends on the
definition of another function. (First, clang is making an executable, not a
Unix shared library where symbol-interposition can happen. Second, the
definition in inside the <code>class{}</code> definition so all translation units must
have the same definition. Like with the <code>inline</code> keyword.)</p>
<p><strong>So a compiler could emit just a<code>ret</code> or <code>ud2</code> (illegal instruction) as the
definition for <code>main</code>, because the path of execution starting at the top of
<code>main</code> unavoidably encounters Undefined Behaviour.</strong> (Which the compiler can
see at compile time if it decided to follow the path through the non-inline
constructor.)</p>
<p>Any program that encounters UB is totally undefined for its entire existence.
But UB inside a function or <code>if()</code> branch that never actually runs doesn't
corrupt the rest of the program. In practice that means that compilers can
decide to emit an illegal instruction, or a <code>ret</code>, or not emit anything and
fall into the next block / function, for the whole basic block that can be
proven at compile time to contain or lead to UB.</p>
<p><strong>GCC and Clang in practice <em>do</em> actually sometimes emit <code>ud2</code> on UB, instead
of even trying to generate code for paths of execution that make no sense.</strong>
Or for cases like falling off the end of a non-<code>void</code> function, gcc will
sometimes omit a <code>ret</code> instruction. If you were thinking that "my function
will just return with whatever garbage is in RAX", you are sorely mistaken.
<strong>Modern C++ compilers don't treat the language like a portable assembly
language any more. Your program really has to be valid C++, without making
assumptions about how a stand-alone non inlined version of your function might
look in asm.</strong></p>
<p>Another fun example is Why does unaligned access to mmap'ed memory sometimes
segfault on AMD64?. x86 doesn't fault on unaligned integers, right? So why
would a misaligned <code>uint16_t*</code> be a problem? Because <code>alignof(uint16_t) == 2</code>,
and violating that assumption led to a segfault when auto-vectorizing with
SSE2.</p>
<p><strong>See also</strong> What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior</p>
<h2>1/3, an article by a clang developer.</h2>
<h3>Key point: if the compiler noticed the UB at compile time, it <em>could</em>
</h3>
<p>"break" (emit surprising asm) the path through your code that causes UB even
if targeting an ABI where any bit-pattern is a valid object representation for
<code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>Expect total hostility toward many mistakes by the programmer, especially
things modern compilers warn about. This is why you should use <code>-Wall</code> and fix
warnings. C++ is not a user-friendly language, and something in C++ can be
unsafe even if it would be safe in asm on the target you're compiling for.
(e.g. signed overflow is UB in C++ and compilers will assume it doesn't
happen, even when compiling for 2's complement x86, unless you use <code>clang/gcc
-fwrapv</code>.)</p>
<p>Compile-time-visible UB is always dangerous, and it's really hard to be sure
(with link-time optimization) that you've really hidden UB from the compiler
and can thus reason about what kind of asm it will generate.</p>
<p>Not to be over-dramatic; often compilers do let you get away with some things
and emit code like you're expecting even when something is UB. But maybe it
will be a problem in the future if compiler devs implement some optimization
that gains more info about value-ranges (e.g. that a variable is non-negative,
maybe allowing it to optimize sign-extension to free zero-extension on
x86-64). For example, in current gcc and clang, doing <code>tmp = a+INT_MIN</code>
doesn't optimize <code>a&lt;0</code> as always-false, only that <code>tmp</code> is always negative.
(Because <code>INT_MIN</code> + <code>a=INT_MAX</code> is negative on this 2's complement target,
and <code>a</code> can't be any higher than that.)</p>
<p>So gcc/clang don't currently backtrack to derive range info for the inputs of
a calculation, only on the results based on the assumption of no signed
overflow: example on Godbolt. I don't know if this is optimization is
intentionally "missed" in the name of user-friendliness or what.</p>
<p>Also note that <strong>implementations (aka compilers) are allowed to define
behaviour that ISO C++ leaves undefined</strong>. For example, all compilers that
support Intel's intrinsics (like <code>_mm_add_ps(__m128, __m128)</code> for manual SIMD
vectorization) must allow forming mis-aligned pointers, which is UB in C++
even if you <em>don't</em> dereference them. <code>__m128i _mm_loadu_si128(const __m128i
*)</code> does unaligned loads by taking a misaligned <code>__m128i*</code> arg, not a <code>void*</code>
or <code>char*</code>. Is <code>reinterpret_cast</code>ing between hardware SIMD vector pointer and
the corresponding type an undefined behavior?</p>
<p>GNU C/C++ also defines the behaviour of left-shifting a negative signed number
(even without <code>-fwrapv</code>), separately from the normal signed-overflow UB rules.
(This is UB in ISO C++, while right shifts of signed numbers are
implementation-defined (logical vs. arithmetic); good quality implementations
choose arithmetic on HW that has arithmetic right shifts, but ISO C++ doesn't
specify). This is documented in the GCC manual's Integer section, along with
defining implementation-defined behaviour that C standards require
implementations to define one way or another.</p>
<p>There are definitely quality-of-implementation issues that compiler developers
care about; they generally aren't <em>trying</em> to make compilers that are
intentionally hostile, but taking advantage of all the UB potholes in C++
(except ones they choose to define) to optimize better can be nearly
indistinguishable at times.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Footnote 1</strong> : The upper 56 bits can be garbage which the callee must
ignore, as usual for types narrower than a register.</p>
<p>( <strong>Other ABIs <em>do</em> make different choices here</strong>. Some do require narrow
integer types to be zero- or sign-extended to fill a register when passed to
or returned from functions, like MIPS64 and PowerPC64. See the last section of
this x86-64 answer which compares vs. those earlier ISAs.)</p>
<p>For example, a caller might have calculated <code>a &amp; 0x01010101</code> in RDI and used
it for something else, before calling <code>bool_func(a&amp;1)</code>. The caller could
optimize away the <code>&amp;1</code> because it already did that to the low byte as part of
<code>and edi, 0x01010101</code>, and it knows the callee is required to ignore the high
bytes.</p>
<p>Or if a bool is passed as the 3rd arg, maybe a caller optimizing for code-size
loads it with <code>mov dl, [mem]</code> instead of <code>movzx edx, [mem]</code>, saving 1 byte at
the cost of a false dependency on the old value of RDX (or other partial-
register effect, depending on CPU model). Or for the first arg, <code>mov dil, byte
[r10]</code> instead of <code>movzx edi, byte [r10]</code>, because both require a REX prefix
anyway.</p>
<p>This is why clang emits <code>movzx eax, dil</code> in <code>Serialize</code>, instead of <code>sub eax,
edi</code>. (For integer args, clang violates this ABI rule, instead depending on
the undocumented behaviour of gcc and clang to zero- or sign-extend narrow
integers to 32 bits. Is a sign or zero extension required when adding a 32bit
offset to a pointer for the x86-64 ABI? So I was interested to see that it
doesn't do the same thing for <code>bool</code>.)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Footnote 2:</strong> After branching, you'd just have a 4-byte <code>mov</code>-immediate, or
a 4-byte + 1-byte store. The length is implicit in the store widths + offsets.</p>
<p>OTOH, glibc memcpy will do two 4-byte loads/stores with an overlap that
depends on length, so this really does end up making the whole thing free of
conditional branches on the boolean. See the <code>L(between_4_7):</code> block in
glibc's memcpy/memmove. Or at least, go the same way for either boolean in
memcpy's branching to select a chunk size.</p>
<p>If inlining, you could use 2x <code>mov</code>-immediate + <code>cmov</code> and a conditional
offset, or you could leave the string data in memory.</p>
<p>Or if tuning for Intel Ice Lake (with the Fast Short REP MOV feature), an
actual <code>rep movsb</code> might be optimal. glibc <code>memcpy</code> might start using <code>rep
movsb</code> for small sizes on CPUs with that feature, saving a lot of branching.</p>

<h2>Tools for detecting UB and usage of uninitialized values</h2>
<p>In gcc and clang, you can compile with <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code> to add run-time
instrumentation that will warn or error out on UB that happens at runtime.
That won't catch unitialized variables, though. (Because it doesn't increase
type sizes to make room for an "uninitialized" bit).</p>
<p>See https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/16/gcc-undefined-behavior-
sanitizer-ubsan/</p>
<p><strong>To find usage of uninitialized data, there's Address Sanitizer and Memory
Sanitizer in clang/LLVM.</strong>
https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer shows examples of
<code>clang -fsanitize=memory -fPIE -pie</code> detecting uninitialized memory reads. It
might work best if you compile <em>without</em> optimization, so all reads of
variables end up actually loading from memory in the asm. They show it being
used at <code>-O2</code> in a case where the load wouldn't optimize away. I haven't tried
it myself. (In some cases, e.g. not initializing an accumulator before summing
an array, clang -O3 will emit code that sums into a vector register that it
never initialized. So with optimization, you can have a case where there's no
memory read associated with the UB. But <code>-fsanitize=memory</code> changes the
generated asm, and might result in a check for this.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will tolerate copying of uninitialized memory, and also simple logic and
arithmetic operations with it. In general, MemorySanitizer silently tracks
the spread of uninitialized data in memory, and reports a warning when a
code branch is taken (or not taken) depending on an uninitialized value.</p>
<p>MemorySanitizer implements a subset of functionality found in Valgrind
(Memcheck tool).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should work for this case because the call to glibc <code>memcpy</code> with a
<code>length</code> calculated from uninitialized memory will (inside the library) result
in a branch based on <code>length</code>. If it had inlined a fully branchless version
that just used <code>cmov</code>, indexing, and two stores, it might not have worked.</p>
<p>Valgrind's <code>memcheck</code> will also look for this kind of problem, again not
complaining if the program simply copies around uninitialized data. But it
says it will detect when a "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised
value(s)", to try to catch any externally-visible behaviour that depends on
uninitialized data.</p>
<p>Perhaps the idea behind not flagging just a load is that structs can have
padding, and copying the whole struct (including padding) with a wide vector
load/store is not an error even if the individual members were only written
one at a time. At the asm level, the information about what was padding and
what is actually part of the value has been lost.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The compiler is allowed to assume that a boolean value passed as an argument
is a valid boolean value (i.e. one which has been initialised or converted to
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>). The <code>true</code> value doesn't have to be the same as the
integer 1 -- indeed, there can be various representations of <code>true</code> and
<code>false</code> -- but the parameter must be some valid representation of one of
those two values, where "valid representation" is implementation-defined.</p>
<p>So if you fail to initialise a <code>bool</code>, or if you succeed in overwriting it
through some pointer of a different type, then the compiler's assumptions will
be wrong and Undefined Behaviour will ensue. You had been warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>50) Using a bool value in ways described by this International Standard as
“undefined”, such as by examining the value of an uninitialized automatic
object, might cause it to behave as if it is neither true nor false.
