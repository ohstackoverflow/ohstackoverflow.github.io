    <p>Does anyone know what is the worst possible asymptotic slowdown that can
happen when programming purely functionally as opposed to imperatively (i.e.
allowing side-effects)?</p>
<p><em>Clarification from comment by itowlson</em> : is there any problem for which the
best known non-destructive algorithm is asymptotically worse than the best
known destructive algorithm, and if so by how much?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>According to Pippenger [1996], when comparing a Lisp system that is purely
functional (and has strict evaluation semantics, not lazy) to one that can
mutate data, an algorithm written for the impure Lisp that runs in O( <em>n</em> )
can be translated to an algorithm in the pure Lisp that runs in O( <em>n</em> log <em>n</em>
) time (based on work by Ben-Amram and Galil [1992] about simulating random
access memory using only pointers). Pippenger also establishes that there are
algorithms for which that is the best you can do; there are problems which are
O( <em>n</em> ) in the impure system which are Ω( <em>n</em> log <em>n</em> ) in the pure system.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats to be made about this paper. The most significant is
that it does not address lazy functional languages, such as Haskell. Bird,
Jones and De Moor [1997] demonstrate that the problem constructed by Pippenger
can be solved in a lazy functional language in O( <em>n</em> ) time, but they do not
establish (and as far as I know, no one has) whether or not a lazy functional
language can solve all problems in the same asymptotic running time as a
language with mutation.</p>
<p>The problem constructed by Pippenger requires Ω( <em>n</em> log <em>n</em> ) is specifically
constructed to achieve this result, and is not necessarily representative of
practical, real-world problems. There are a few restrictions on the problem
that are a bit unexpected, but necessary for the proof to work; in particular,
the problem requires that results are computed on-line, without being able to
access future input, and that the input consists of a sequence of atoms from
an unbounded set of possible atoms, rather than a fixed size set. And the
paper only establishes (lower bound) results for an impure algorithm of linear
running time; for problems that require a greater running time, it is possible
that the extra O(log <em>n</em> ) factor seen in the linear problem may be able to be
"absorbed" in the process of extra operations necessary for algorithms with
greater running times. These clarifications and open questions are explored
briefly by Ben-Amram [1996].</p>
<p>In practice, many algorithms can be implemented in a pure functional language
at the same efficiency as in a language with mutable data structures. For a
good reference on techniques to use for implementing purely functional data
structures efficiently, see Chris Okasaki's "Purely Functional Data
Structures" [Okasaki 1998] (which is an expanded version of his thesis
[Okasaki 1996]).</p>
<p>Anyone who needs to implement algorithms on purely-functional data structures
should read Okasaki. You can always get at worst an O(log <em>n</em> ) slowdown per
operation by simulating mutable memory with a balanced binary tree, but in
many cases you can do considerably better than that, and Okasaki describes
many useful techniques, from amortized techniques to real-time ones that do
the amortized work incrementally. Purely functional data structures can be a
bit difficult to work with and analyze, but they provide many benefits like
referential transparency that are helpful in compiler optimization, in
parallel and distributed computing, and in implementation of features like
versioning, undo, and rollback.</p>
<p>Note also that all of this discusses only asymptotic running times. Many
techniques for implementing purely functional data structures give you a
certain amount of constant factor slowdown, due to extra bookkeeping necessary
for them to work, and implementation details of the language in question. The
benefits of purely functional data structures may outweigh these constant
factor slowdowns, so you will generally need to make trade-offs based on the
problem in question.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There are indeed several algorithms and data structures for which no
asymptotically efficient purely functional solution (t.i. one implementable in
pure lambda calculus) is known, even with laziness.</p>
<ul>
<li>The aforementioned union-find</li>
<li>Hash tables</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Some graph algorithms</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we assume that in "imperative" languages access to memory is O(1)
whereas in theory that can't be so asymptotically (i.e. for unbounded problem
sizes) and access to memory within a huge dataset is always O(log n), which
can be emulated in a functional language.</p>
<p>Also, we must remember that actually all modern functional languages provide
mutable data, and Haskell even provides it without sacrificing purity (the ST
monad).</p>
