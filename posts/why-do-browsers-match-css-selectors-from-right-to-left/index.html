    <p>CSS Selectors are matched by browser engines from right to left. So they first

<ol>
<li>Why is this?</li>
<li>Is it just because the spec says?</li>
<li>Does it affect the eventual layout if it was evaluated from left to right?</li>
</ol>
<p>To me the simplest way to do it would be use the selectors with the least
number of elements. So IDs first (as they should only return 1 element). Then
maybe classes or an element that has the fewest number of nodes — e.g. there
may only be one span on the page so go directly to that node with any rule
that references a span.</p>
<p>Here are some links backing up my claims</p>

<p>It sounds like that it is done this way to avoid having to look at all the
children of parent (which could be many) rather than all the parents of a
child which must be one. Even if the DOM is deep it would only look at one
node per level rather than multiple in the RTL matching. Is it easier/faster
to evaluate CSS selectors LTR or RTL?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that when a browser is doing selector matching it has one element
(the one it's trying to determine style for) and all your rules and their
selectors and it needs to find which rules match the element. This is
different from the usual jQuery thing, say, where you only have one selector
and you need to find all the elements that match that selector.</p>
<p>If you only had one selector and only one element to compare against that
selector, then left-to-right makes more sense in some cases. But that's
decidedly <em>not</em> the browser's situation. The browser is trying to render Gmail
or whatever and has the one <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> it's trying to style and the 10,000+
rules Gmail puts in its stylesheet (I'm not making that number up).</p>
<p>In particular, in the situation the browser is looking at most of the
selectors it's considering <em>don't</em> match the element in question. So the
problem becomes one of deciding that a selector doesn't match as fast as
possible; if that requires a bit of extra work in the cases that do match you
still win due to all the work you save in the cases that don't match.</p>
<p>If you start by just matching the rightmost part of the selector against your
element, then chances are it won't match and you're done. If it does match,
you have to do more work, but only proportional to your tree depth, which is
not that big in most cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you start by matching the leftmost part of the
selector... what do you match it against? You have to start walking the DOM,
looking for nodes that might match it. Just discovering that there's nothing
matching that leftmost part might take a while.</p>
<p>So browsers match from the right; it gives an obvious starting point and lets
you get rid of most of the candidate selectors very quickly. You can see some
data at
http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.layout/browse_thread/thread/b185e455a0b3562a/7db34de545c17665
(though the notation is confusing), but the upshot is that for Gmail in
particular two years ago, for 70% of the (rule, element) pairs you could
decide that the rule does not match after just examining the tag/class/id
parts of the rightmost selector for the rule. The corresponding number for
Mozilla's pageload performance test suite was 72%. So it's really worth trying
to get rid of those 2/3 of all rules as fast as you can and then only worry
about matching the remaining 1/3.</p>
<p>Note also that there are other optimizations browsers already do to avoid even
trying to match rules that definitely won't match. For example, if the
rightmost selector has an id and that id doesn't match the element's id, then
there will be no attempt to match that selector against that element at all in
Gecko: the set of "selectors with IDs" that are attempted comes from a
hashtable lookup on the element's ID. So this is 70% of the rules which have a
pretty good chance of matching that <em>still</em> don't match after considering just
the tag/class/id of the rightmost selector.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Right to left parsing, also called as <strong>bottom-up parsing</strong> is actually
efficient for the browser.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">#</span><span class="nn">menu</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">#00f</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The browser first checks for <strong><code>a</code></strong> , then <strong><code>li</code></strong> , then <strong><code>ul</code></strong> , and
then <strong><code>#menu</code></strong>.</p>
<p>This is because as the browser is scanning the page it just needs to look at
the current element/node and all the previous nodes/elements that it has
scanned.</p>
<p>The thing to note is that the <strong>browser starts processing moment it gets a
complete tag/node</strong> and needn't have to wait for the whole page except when it
finds a script, in which case it temporarily pauses and completes execution of
the script and then goes forward.</p>
<p>If it does the other way round it will be inefficient because the browser
found the element it was scanning on the first check, but was then forced to
continue looking through the document for all the additional selectors. For
this the browser needs to have the entire html and may need to scan the whole
page before it starts css painting.</p>
<p>This is contrary to how most libs parse dom. There the dom is constructed and
it doesn't need to scan the entire page just find the first element and then
go on matching others inside it .</p>
