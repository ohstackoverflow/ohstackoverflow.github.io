    <p>I am a Java programmer who is new to the corporate world. Recently I've
developed an application using Groovy and Java. All through the code I wrote
used quite a good number of statics. I was asked by the senior technical lot
to cut down on the number of statics used. I've googled about the same, and I
find that many programmers are fairly against using static variables.</p>
<p>I find static variables more convenient to use. And I presume that they are
efficient too (please correct me if I am wrong), because if I had to make
10,000 calls to a function within a class, I would be glad to make the method
static and use a straightforward <code>Class.methodCall()</code> on it instead of
cluttering the memory with 10,000 instances of the class, right?</p>
<p>Moreover statics reduce the inter-dependencies on the other parts of the code.
They can act as perfect state holders. Adding to this I find that statics are
widely implemented in some languages like Smalltalk and Scala. So why is this
opposition to statics prevalent among programmers (especially in the world of
Java)?</p>
<p>PS: please do correct me if my assumptions about statics are wrong.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Static variables represent global state. That's hard to reason about and hard
to test: if I create a new instance of an object, I can reason about its new
state within tests. If I use code which is using static variables, it could be
in any state - and anything could be modifying it.</p>
<p>I could go on for quite a while, but the bigger concept to think about is that
the tighter the scope of something, the easier it is to reason about. We're
good at thinking about small things, but it's hard to reason about the state
of a million line system if there's no modularity. This applies to all sorts
of things, by the way - not just static variables.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Its not very object oriented:</strong> One reason statics might be considered
"evil" by some people is they are contrary the object-oriented paradigm. In
particular, it violates the principle that data is encapsulated in objects
(that can be extended, information hiding, etc). Statics, in the way you are
describing using them, are essentially to use them as a global variable to
avoid dealing with issues like scope. However, global variables is one of the
defining characteristics of procedural or imperative programming paradigm, not
a characteristic of "good" object oriented code. This is not to say the
procedural paradigm is bad, but I get the impression your supervisor expects
you to be writing "good object oriented code" and you're really wanting to
write "good procedural code".</p>
<p>There are many gotchyas in Java when you start using statics that are not
always immediately obvious. For example, if you have two copies of your
program running in the same VM, will they shre the static variable's value and
mess with the state of each other? Or what happens when you extend the class,
can you override the static member? Is your VM running out of memory because
you have insane numbers of statics and that memory cannot be reclaimed for
other needed instance objects?</p>
<p><strong>Object Lifetime:</strong> Additionally, statics have a lifetime that matches the
entire runtime of the program. This means, even once you're done using your
class, the memory from all those static variables cannot be garbage collected.
If, for example, instead, you made your variables non-static, and in your
main() function you made a single instance of your class, and then asked your
class to execute a particular function 10,000 times, once those 10,000 calls
were done, and you delete your references to the single instance, all your
static variables could be garbage collected and reused.</p>
<p><strong>Prevents certain re-use:</strong> Also, static methods cannot be used to implement
an interface, so static methods can prevent certain object oriented features
from being usable.</p>
<p><strong>Other Options:</strong> If efficiency is your primary concern, there might be other
better ways to solve the speed problem than considering only the advantage of
invocation being usually faster than creation. Consider whether the transient
or volatile modifiers are needed anywhere. To preserve the ability to be
inlined, a method could be marked as final instead of static. Method
parameters and other variables can be marked final to permit certain compiler
optimiazations based on assumptions about what can change those variables. An
instance object could be reused multiple times rather than creating a new
instance each time. There may be compliler optimization switches that should
be turned on for the app in general. Perhaps, the design should be set up so
that the 10,000 runs can be multi-threaded and take advantage of multi-
processor cores. If portablity isn't a concern, maybe a native method would
get you better speed than your statics do.</p>
<p>If for some reason you do not want multiple copies of an object, the singleton
design pattern, has advantages over static objects, such as thread-safety
(presuming your singleton is coded well), permitting lazy-initialization,
guaranteeing the object has been properly initialized when it is used, sub-
classing, advantages in testing and refactoring your code, not to mention, if
at some point you change your mind about only wanting one instance of an
object it is MUCH easier to remove the code to prevent duplicate instances
than it is to refactor all your static variable code to use instance
variables. I've had to do that before, its not fun, and you end up having to
edit a lot more classes, which increases your risk of introducing new
bugs...so much better to set things up "right" the first time, even if it
seems like it has its disadvantages. For me, the re-work required should you
decide down the road you need multiple copies of something is probably one of
most compelling reasons to use statics as infrequently as possible. And thus I
would also disagree with your statement that statics reduce inter-
dependencies, I think you will end up with code that is more coupled if you
have lots of statics that can be directly accessed, rather than an object that
"knows how to do something" on itself.</p>
