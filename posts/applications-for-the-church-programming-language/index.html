    <p>Has anyone worked with the programming language Church? Can anyone recommend
practical applications? I just discovered it, and while it sounds like it
addresses some long-standing problems in AI and machine-learning, I'm
skeptical. I had never heard of it, and was surprised to find it's actually
been around for a few years, having been announced in the paper Church: a
language for generative models.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I'm not sure what to say about the matter of practical applications. Does
modeling cognitive abilities with generative models constitute a "practical
application" in your mind?</p>
<p>The key importance of Church (at least right now) is that it allows those of
us working with probabilistic inference solutions to AI problems a simpler way
to model. It's essentially a subset of Lisp.</p>
<p>I disagree with Chris S that it is at all a toy language. While some of these
inference problems can be replicated in other languages (I've built several in
Matlab) they generally aren't very reusable and you really have to love
working in 4 and 5 for loops deep (I hate it).</p>
<p>Instead of tackling the problem that way, Church uses the recursive advantages
of lamda calaculus and also allows for something called memoization which is
really useful for generative models since your generative model is often not
the same one trial after trial--though for testing you really need this.</p>
<p>I would say that if what you're doing has anything to do with Bayesian
Networks, Hierarchical Bayesian Models, probabilistic solutions to POMDPs or
Dynamic Bayesian Networks then I think Church is a great help. For what it's
worth, I've worked with both Noah and Josh (two of Church's authors) and no
one has a better handle on probabilistic inference right now (IMHO).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Church is part of the family of probabilistic programming languages that
allows the separation of the estimation of a model from its definition. This
makes probabilistic modeling and inference a lot more accessible to people
that want to apply machine learning but who are not themselves hardcore
machine learning researchers.</p>
<p>For a long time, probabilistic programming meant you'd have to come up with a
model for your data and derive the estimation of the model yourself: you have
some observed values, and you want to learn the parameters. The structure of
the model is closely related to how you estimate the parameters, and you'd
have to be pretty advanced knowledge of machine learning to do the
computations correctly. The recent probabilistic programming languages are an
attempt to address that and make things more accessible for data scientists or
people doing work that applies machine learning.</p>
<p>As an analogy, consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a programmer and you want to run some code on a computer. Back in
the 1970s, you had to write assembly language on punch cards and feed them
into a mainframe (for which you had to book time on) in order to run your
program. It is now 2014, and there are high-level, simple to learn languages
that you can write code in even with no knowledge of how computer
architecture works. It's still helpful to understand how computers work to
write in those languages, but you don't <strong>have</strong> to, and many more people
write code than if you had to program with punch cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probabilistic programming languages do the same for machine learning with
statistical models. Also, Church isn't the only choice for this. If you aren't
a functional programming devotee, you can also check out the following
frameworks for Bayesian inference in graphical models:</p>
