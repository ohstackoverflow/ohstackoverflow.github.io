<ul>
<li>So, does a child scope always prototypically inherit from its parent scope? </li>
<li>Are there exceptions? </li>
<li>When it does inherit, is it always normal JavaScript prototypal inheritance?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Quick answer</strong> :<br>
A child scope normally prototypically inherits from its parent scope, but not
always. One exception to this rule is a directive with <code>scope: { ... }</code> --
this creates an "isolate" scope that does not prototypically inherit. This
construct is often used when creating a "reusable component" directive.</p>
<p>As for the nuances, scope inheritance is normally straightfoward... until you
need <strong>2-way data binding</strong> (i.e., form elements, ng-model) in the child
scope. Ng-repeat, ng-switch, and ng-include can trip you up if you try to bind
to a <strong>primitive</strong> (e.g., number, string, boolean) in the parent scope from
inside the child scope. It doesn't work the way most people expect it should
work. The child scope gets its own property that hides/shadows the parent
property of the same name. Your workarounds are</p>
<ol>
<li>define objects in the parent for your model, then reference a property of that object in the child: parentObj.someProp</li>
<li>use $parent.parentScopeProperty (not always possible, but easier than 1. where possible)</li>
<li>define a function on the parent scope, and call it from the child (not always possible)</li>
</ol>
<p>New AngularJS developers often do not realize that <code>ng-repeat</code>, <code>ng-switch</code>,
<code>ng-view</code>, <code>ng-include</code> and <code>ng-if</code> all create new child scopes, so the
problem often shows up when these directives are involved. (See this example
for a quick illustration of the problem.)</p>
<p>This issue with primitives can be easily avoided by following the "best
practice" of always have a '.' in your ng-models – watch 3 minutes worth.
Misko demonstrates the primitive binding issue with <code>ng-switch</code>.</p>
<p>Having a '.' in your models will ensure that prototypal inheritance is in
play. So, use</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"text"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"someObj.prop1"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="o">&lt;!--</span><span class="n">rather</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">than</span>

<p><strong>L-o-n-g answer</strong> :</p>
<h3>JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance</h3>
<p><strong>Also placed on the AngularJS wiki:</strong>
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes</p>
<p>It is important to first have a solid understanding of prototypal inheritance,
especially if you are coming from a server-side background and you are more
familiar with class-ical inheritance. So let's review that first.</p>
<p>Suppose parentScope has properties aString, aNumber, anArray, anObject, and
aFunction. If childScope prototypically inherits from parentScope, we have:</p>
<p><img alt="prototypal inheritance" src="../../images/aTAGg.png"></p>
<p>(Note that to save space, I show the <code>anArray</code> object as a single blue object
with its three values, rather than an single blue object with three separate
gray literals.)</p>
<p>If we try to access a property defined on the parentScope from the child
scope, JavaScript will first look in the child scope, not find the property,
then look in the inherited scope, and find the property. (If it didn't find
the property in the parentScope, it would continue up the prototype chain...
all the way up to the root scope). So, these are all true:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">childScope.aString === 'parent string'
childScope.anArray[1] === 20
childScope.anObject.property1 === 'parent prop1'
childScope.aFunction() === 'parent output'
</pre></div>

<p>Suppose we then do this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">childScope.aString = 'child string'
</pre></div>

<p>The prototype chain is not consulted, and a new aString property is added to
the childScope. <strong>This new property hides/shadows the parentScope property
with the same name.</strong> This will become very important when we discuss ng-
repeat and ng-include below.</p>
<p><img alt="property hiding" src="../../images/OyVPW.png"></p>
<p>Suppose we then do this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">childScope.anArray[1] = '22'
childScope.anObject.property1 = 'child prop1'
</pre></div>

<p>The prototype chain is consulted because the objects (anArray and anObject)
are not found in the childScope. The objects are found in the parentScope, and
the property values are updated on the original objects. No new properties are
added to the childScope; no new objects are created. (Note that in JavaScript
arrays and functions are also objects.)</p>
<p><img alt="follow the prototype chain" src="../../images/2QceU.png"></p>
<p>Suppose we then do this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">childScope.anArray = [100, 555]
childScope.anObject = { name: 'Mark', country: 'USA' }
</pre></div>

<p>The prototype chain is not consulted, and child scope gets two new object
properties that hide/shadow the parentScope object properties with the same
names.</p>
<p><img alt="more property hiding" src="../../images/hKetH.png"></p>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we read childScope.propertyX, and childScope has propertyX, then the prototype chain is not consulted.</li>
<li>If we set childScope.propertyX, the prototype chain is not consulted.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last scenario:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">delete childScope.anArray
childScope.anArray[1] === 22  // true
</pre></div>

<p>We deleted the childScope property first, then when we try to access the
property again, the prototype chain is consulted.</p>
<p><img alt="after removing a child property" src="../../images/56uoe.png"></p>

<h3>Angular Scope Inheritance</h3>
<p>The contenders:</p>
<ul>
<li>The following create new scopes, and inherit prototypically: ng-repeat, ng-include, ng-switch, ng-controller, directive with <code>scope: true</code>, directive with <code>transclude: true</code>.</li>
<li>The following creates a new scope which does not inherit prototypically: directive with <code>scope: { ... }</code>. This creates an "isolate" scope instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, by default, directives do not create new scope -- i.e., the default is
<code>scope: false</code>.</p>
<h4>ng-include</h4>
<p>Suppose we have in our controller:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">$</span><span class="nt">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">myPrimitive</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">50</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">$</span><span class="nt">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">myObject</span><span class="w">    </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">aNumber</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And in our HTML:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;script</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/ng-template"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"/tpl1.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">"myPrimitive"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">ng-include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"'/tpl1.html'"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;script</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/ng-template"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"/tpl2.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">"myObject.aNumber"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">ng-include</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"'/tpl2.html'"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Each ng-include generates a new child scope, which prototypically inherits
from the parent scope.</p>
<p><img alt="ng-include child scopes" src="../../images/ziDfx.png"></p>
<p>Typing (say, "77") into the first input textbox causes the child scope to get
a new <code>myPrimitive</code> scope property that hides/shadows the parent scope
property of the same name. This is probably not what you want/expect.</p>
<p><img alt="ng-include with a primitive" src="../../images/7l8dg.png"></p>
<p>Typing (say, "99") into the second input textbox does not result in a new
child property. Because tpl2.html binds the model to an object property,
prototypal inheritance kicks in when the ngModel looks for object myObject --
it finds it in the parent scope.</p>
<p><img alt="ng-include with an object" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZqqloMS.png"></p>
<p>We can rewrite the first template to use $parent, if we don't want to change
our model from a primitive to an object:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;input ng-model="$parent.myPrimitive"&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Typing (say, "22") into this input textbox does not result in a new child
property. The model is now bound to a property of the parent scope (because
$parent is a child scope property that references the parent scope).</p>
<p><img alt="ng-include with $parent" src="../../images/kd8pj.png"></p>
<p>For all scopes (prototypal or not), Angular always tracks a parent-child
relationship (i.e., a hierarchy), via scope properties $parent, $$childHead
and $$childTail. I normally don't show these scope properties in the diagrams.</p>
<p>For scenarios where form elements are not involved, another solution is to
define a function on the parent scope to modify the primitive. Then ensure the
child always calls this function, which will be available to the child scope
due to prototypal inheritance. E.g.,</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">// in the parent scope</span>
<span class="no">$</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">setMyPrimitive</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">     </span><span class="no">$</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">myPrimitive</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here is a sample fiddle that uses this "parent function" approach. (The fiddle
was written as part of this answer:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/14104318/215945.)</p>
<p>See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/13782671/215945 and
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1267.</p>
<h4>ng-switch</h4>
<p>ng-switch scope inheritance works just like ng-include. So if you need 2-way
data binding to a primitive in the parent scope, use $parent, or change the
model to be an object and then bind to a property of that object. This will
avoid child scope hiding/shadowing of parent scope properties.</p>
<p>See also AngularJS, bind scope of a switch-case?</p>
<h4>ng-repeat</h4>
<p>Ng-repeat works a little differently. Suppose we have in our controller:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$scope.myArrayOfPrimitives = [ 11, 22 ];
$scope.myArrayOfObjects    = [{num: 101}, {num: 202}]
</pre></div>

<p>And in our HTML:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">ng-repeat=</span><span class="s">"num in myArrayOfPrimitives"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="nt">&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">"num"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">ng-repeat=</span><span class="s">"obj in myArrayOfObjects"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">       </span><span class="nt">&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">"obj.num"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>For each item/iteration, ng-repeat creates a new scope, which prototypically
inherits from the parent scope, <strong>but it also assigns the item's value to a
new property on the new child scope</strong>. (The name of the new property is the
loop variable's name.) Here's what the Angular source code for ng-repeat
actually is:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">childScope</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="k">new</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">child</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">scope</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">prototypically</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">inherits</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">parent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">scope</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="n">childScope</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">valueIdent</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">value</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">creates</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">childScope</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">property</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If item is a primitive (as in myArrayOfPrimitives), essentially a copy of the
value is assigned to the new child scope property. Changing the child scope
property's value (i.e., using ng-model, hence child scope <code>num</code>) does <strong>not</strong>
change the array the parent scope references. So in the first ng-repeat above,
each child scope gets a <code>num</code> property that is independent of the
myArrayOfPrimitives array:</p>
<p><img alt="ng-repeat with primitives" src="../../images/nLoiW.png"></p>
<p>This ng-repeat will not work (like you want/expect it to). Typing into the
textboxes changes the values in the gray boxes, which are only visible in the
child scopes. What we want is for the inputs to affect the myArrayOfPrimitives
array, not a child scope primitive property. To accomplish this, we need to
change the model to be an array of objects.</p>
<p>So, if item is an object, a reference to the original object (not a copy) is
assigned to the new child scope property. Changing the child scope property's
value (i.e., using ng-model, hence <code>obj.num</code>) <strong>does</strong> change the object the
parent scope references. So in the second ng-repeat above, we have:</p>
<p><img alt="ng-repeat with objects" src="../../images/QSjTJ.png"></p>
<p>(I colored one line gray just so that it is clear where it is going.)</p>
<p>This works as expected. Typing into the textboxes changes the values in the
gray boxes, which are visible to both the child and parent scopes.</p>
<p>See also Difficulty with ng-model, ng-repeat, and inputs and
https://stackoverflow.com/a/13782671/215945</p>
<h4>ng-controller</h4>
<p>Nesting controllers using ng-controller results in normal prototypal
inheritance, just like ng-include and ng-switch, so the same techniques apply.
However, "it is considered bad form for two controllers to share information
via $scope inheritance" -- http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-sticky-notes-
pt-1-architecture/ A service should be used to share data between controllers
instead.</p>
<p>(If you really want to share data via controllers scope inheritance, there is
nothing you need to do. The child scope will have access to all of the parent
scope properties. See also Controller load order differs when loading or
navigating)</p>
<h4>directives</h4>
<ol>
<li>default (<code>scope: false</code>) - the directive does not create a new scope, so there is no inheritance here. This is easy, but also dangerous because, e.g., a directive might think it is creating a new property on the scope, when in fact it is clobbering an existing property. This is not a good choice for writing directives that are intended as reusable components.</li>
<li>
<code>scope: true</code> - the directive creates a new child scope that prototypically inherits from the parent scope. If more than one directive (on the same DOM element) requests a new scope, only one new child scope is created. Since we have "normal" prototypal inheritance, this is like ng-include and ng-switch, so be wary of 2-way data binding to parent scope primitives, and child scope hiding/shadowing of parent scope properties.</li>
<li>
<p><code>scope: { ... }</code> - the directive creates a new isolate/isolated scope. It does not prototypically inherit. This is usually your best choice when creating reusable components, since the directive cannot accidentally read or modify the parent scope. However, such directives often need access to a few parent scope properties. The object hash is used to set up two-way binding (using '=') or one-way binding (using '@') between the parent scope and the isolate scope. There is also '&amp;' to bind to parent scope expressions. So, these all create local scope properties that are derived from the parent scope. Note that attributes are used to help set up the binding -- you can't just reference parent scope property names in the object hash, you have to use an attribute. E.g., this won't work if you want to bind to parent property <code>parentProp</code> in the isolated scope: <code>&lt;div my-directive&gt;</code> and <code>scope: { localProp: '@parentProp' }</code>. An attribute must be used to specify each parent property that the directive wants to bind to: <code>&lt;div my-directive the-Parent-Prop=parentProp&gt;</code> and <code>scope: { localProp: '@theParentProp' }</code>. <br>
Isolate scope's <code>__proto__</code> references Object. Isolate scope's $parent
references the parent scope, so although it is isolated and doesn't inherit
prototypically from the parent scope, it is still a child scope.<br>
For the picture below we have<br><code>&lt;my-directive interpolated="{{parentProp1}}" twowayBinding="parentProp2"&gt;</code>
and<br><code>scope: { interpolatedProp: '@interpolated', twowayBindingProp:
'=twowayBinding' }</code><br>
Also, assume the directive does this in its linking function:
<code>scope.someIsolateProp = "I'm isolated"</code><br><img alt="isolated scope" src="../../images/MUxS4.png"><br>
For more information on isolate scopes see http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-
sticky-notes-pt-2-isolated-scope/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>transclude: true</code> - the directive creates a new "transcluded" child scope, which prototypically inherits from the parent scope. The transcluded and the isolated scope (if any) are siblings -- the $parent property of each scope references the same parent scope. When a transcluded and an isolate scope both exist, isolate scope property $$nextSibling will reference the transcluded scope. I'm not aware of any nuances with the transcluded scope. <br>
For the picture below, assume the same directive as above with this addition:
<code>transclude: true</code><br><img alt="transcluded scope" src="../../images/fkWHA.png"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This fiddle has a <code>showScope()</code> function that can be used to examine an
isolate and transcluded scope. See the instructions in the comments in the
fiddle.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There are four types of scopes:</p>
<ol>
<li>normal prototypal scope inheritance -- ng-include, ng-switch, ng-controller, directive with <code>scope: true</code>
</li>
<li>normal prototypal scope inheritance with a copy/assignment -- ng-repeat. Each iteration of ng-repeat creates a new child scope, and that new child scope always gets a new property.</li>
<li>isolate scope -- directive with <code>scope: {...}</code>. This one is not prototypal, but '=', '@', and '&amp;' provide a mechanism to access parent scope properties, via attributes.</li>
<li>transcluded scope -- directive with <code>transclude: true</code>. This one is also normal prototypal scope inheritance, but it is also a sibling of any isolate scope.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all scopes (prototypal or not), Angular always tracks a parent-child
relationship (i.e., a hierarchy), via properties $parent and $$childHead and
$$childTail.</p>
<p>Diagrams were generated with graphviz "*.dot" files, which are on github. Tim
Caswell's "Learning JavaScript with Object Graphs" was the inspiration for
using GraphViz for the diagrams.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I in no way want to compete with Mark's answer, but just wanted to highlight
the piece that finally made everything click as someone new to Javascript
inheritance and its prototype chain.</p>
<p><strong>Only property reads search the prototype chain, not writes.</strong> So when you
set</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">myObject.prop = '123';
</pre></div>

<p>It doesn't look up the chain, but when you set</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">myObject.myThing.prop = '123';
</pre></div>

<p><strong>there's a subtle read going on within that write operation</strong> that tries to
look up myThing before writing to its prop. So that's why writing to
object.properties from the child gets at the parent's objects.</p>
