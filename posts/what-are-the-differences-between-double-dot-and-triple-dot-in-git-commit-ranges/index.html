    <p>Some Git commands take commit ranges and one valid syntax is to separate two

<p>What are the differences between the two?</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>It depends on whether you're using a <code>log</code> command or a <code>diff</code> command. In the
<code>log</code> case, it's in the <code>man git-rev-parse</code> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix ^ notation is used.
E.g. ^r1 r2 means commits reachable from r2 but exclude the ones reachable
from r1.</p>
<p>This set operation appears so often that there is a shorthand for it. When
you have two commits r1 and r2 (named according to the syntax explained in
SPECIFYING REVISIONS above), you can ask for commits that are reachable from
r2 excluding those that are reachable from r1 by "^r1 r2" and it can be
written as "r1..r2".</p>
<p>A similar notation "r1...r2" is called symmetric difference of r1 and r2 and
is defined as "r1 r2 --not $(git merge-base --all r1 r2)". It is the set of
commits that are reachable from either one of r1 or r2 but not from both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which basically means that you'll get all commits that are in either of the
two branches, but not in both.</p>
<p>In the <code>diff</code> case, it's in the <code>man git-diff</code> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">  git diff [--options] &lt;commit&gt;...&lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]

      This form is to view the changes on the branch containing and up
</pre></div>

<p>to
          the second <commit>, starting at a common ancestor of both
          <commit>. "git diff A...B" is equivalent to "git diff
          $(git-merge-base A B) B". You can omit any one of <commit>, which
          has the same effect as using HEAD instead.
</commit></commit></commit></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is a bit fuzzy. Basically it means it shows only the differences in that
branch compared to another branch: it looks for the last common commit with
the first committish you gave it, and then diffs the second committish to
that. It's an easy way to see what changes are made in that branch, compared
to this branch, without taking notice of changes in this branch only.</p>
<p>The <code>..</code> is somewhat simpler: In the <code>git-diff</code> case, it's the same as a <code>git
diff A B</code> and just diffs A against B. In the <code>log</code> case, it shows all commits
that are in B but not in A.</p>
