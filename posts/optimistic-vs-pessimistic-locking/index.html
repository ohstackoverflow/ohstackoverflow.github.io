    <p>I understand the differences between optimistic and pessimistic locking. Now,
could someone explain to me when I would use either one in general?</p>
<p>And does the answer to this question change depending on whether or not I'm
using a stored procedure to perform the query?</p>
<p>But just to check, optimistic means "don't lock the table while reading" and
pessimistic means "lock the table while reading."</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, take note of a
version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or
checksums/hashes) and check that the version hasn't changed before you write
the record back. When you write the record back you filter the update on the
version to make sure it's atomic. (i.e. hasn't been updated between when you
check the version and write the record to the disk) and update the version in
one hit.</p>
<p>If the record is dirty (i.e. different version to yours) you abort the
transaction and the user can re-start it.</p>
<p>This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier
architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the
database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually
maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may
not be using the same connection from one access to the next.</p>
<p>Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until
you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic
locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid
Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to
the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server
application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used
independently of the connection.</p>
<p>In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect
using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session
back up through the TxID. This is how distributed transactions using two-phase
commit protocols (such as XA or COM+ Transactions) work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>When dealing with conflicts, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try to avoid the conflict, and that's what Pessimistic Locking does.</li>
<li>Or, you could allow the conflict to occur, but you need to detect it upon committing your transactions, and that's what Optimistic Locking does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's consider the following Lost Update anomaly:</p>
<p><img alt="Lost Update" src="../../images/vCagm.png"></p>
<p>The Lost Update anomaly can happen in the Read Committed isolation level.</p>
<p>In the diagram above we can see that Alice believes she can withdraw 40 from
her <code>account</code> but does not realize that Bob has just changed the account
balance, and now there are only 20 left in this account.</p>
<h3>Pessimistic Locking</h3>
<p>Pessimistic locking achieves this goal by taking a shared or read lock on the
account so Bob is prevented from changing the account.</p>
<p><img alt="Lost Update Pessimistic Locking" src="../../images/oybRy.png"></p>
<p>In the diagram above, both Alice and Bob will acquire a read lock on the
<code>account</code> table row that both users have read. The database acquires these
locks on SQL Server when using Repeatable Read or Serializable.</p>
<p>Because both Alice and Bob have read the <code>account</code> with the PK value of <code>1</code>,
neither of them can change it until one user releases the read lock. This is
because a write operation requires a write/exclusive lock acquisition, and
shared/read locks prevent write/exclusive locks.</p>
<p>Only after Alice has committed her transaction and the read lock was released
on the <code>account</code> row, Bob <code>UPDATE</code> will resume and apply the change. Until
Alice releases the read lock, Bob's UPDATE blocks.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Locking</h3>
<p>Optimistic Locking allows the conflict to occur but detects it upon applying
Alice's UPDATE as the version has changed.</p>
<p><img alt="Application-level transactions" src="../../images/DEdlF.png"></p>
<p>This time, we have an additional <code>version</code> column. The <code>version</code> column is
incremented every time an UPDATE or DELETE is executed, and it is also used in
the WHERE clause of the UPDATE and DELETE statements. For this to work, we
need to issue the SELECT and read the current <code>version</code> prior to executing the
UPDATE or DELETE, as otherwise, we would not know what version value to pass
to the WHERE clause or to increment.</p>
<h3>Application-level transactions</h3>
<p>Relational database systems have emerged in the late 70's early 80's when a
client would, typically, connect to a mainframe via a terminal. That's why we
still see database systems define terms such as SESSION setting.</p>
<p>Nowadays, over the Internet, we no longer execute reads and writes in the
context of the same database transaction, and ACID is no longer sufficient.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the following use case:</p>
<p><img alt="Application-level transactions and Optimistic Locking" src="../../images/FCyHh.png"></p>
<p>Without optimistic locking, there is no way this Lost Update would have been
caught even if the database transactions used Serializable. This is because
reads and writes are executed in separate HTTP requests, hence on different
database transactions.</p>
<p>So, optimistic locking can help you prevent Lost Updates even when using
application-level transactions that incorporate the user-think time as well.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Optimistic locking is a very useful technique, and it works just fine even
when using less-strict isolation levels, like Read Committed, or when reads
and writes are executed in subsequent database transactions.</p>
<p>The downside of optimistic locking is that a rollback will be triggered by the
data access framework upon catching an <code>OptimisticLockException</code>, therefore
losing all the work we've done previously by the currently executing
transaction.</p>
<p>The more contention, the more conflicts, and the greater the chance of
aborting transactions. Rollbacks can be costly for the database system as it
needs to revert all current pending changes which might involve both table
rows and index records.</p>
<p>For this reason, pessimistic locking might be more suitable when conflicts
happen frequently, as it reduces the chance of rolling back transactions.</p>
