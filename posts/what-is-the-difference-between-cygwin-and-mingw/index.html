<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>As a simplification, it's like this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compile something in Cygwin and you are compiling it <em>for Cygwin</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile something in MinGW and you are compiling it <em>for Windows</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Cygwin?</strong></p>
<p>Cygwin is a compatibility layer that makes it easy to port simple Unix-based
applications to Windows, by emulating many of the basic interfaces that Unix-
based operating systems provide, such as pipes, Unix-style file and directory
access, and so on as documented by the POSIX standards. Cygwin is also bundled
with a port of the GNU Compiler Collection and some other tools to the Cygwin
environment.</p>
<p>If you have existing source code that uses POSIX interfaces, you may be able
to compile it for use with Cygwin after making very few or even no changes,
greatly simplifying the process of porting simple IO based Unix code for use
on Windows.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disadvantages of Cygwin</strong></em></p>
<p>Compiling with Cygwin involves linking your program with the Cygwin run-time
environment, which will typically be distributed with your program as the
dynamically linked library <code>cygwin1.dll</code>. This library is open source and
requires software using it to share a compatible open source license, even if
you distribute the dll separately, because the header files and interface are
included. This therefore imposes some restrictions on how you can license your
code.</p>
<p><strong>What is MinGW?</strong></p>
<p>MinGW is a distribution of the GNU compiler tools for native Windows,
including the GNU Compiler Collection, GNU Binutils and GNU Debugger. Also
included are header files and libraries allowing development of native Windows
applications. This therefore will act as an open source alternative to the
Microsoft Visual C++ suite.</p>
<p>It may be possible to use MinGW to compile something that was originally
intended for compiling with Microsoft Visual C++ with relatively minor
modifications.</p>
<p>By default, code compiled in MinGW's GCC will compile to a native Windows
target, including .exe and .dll files, though you could also cross-compile
with the right settings, since you are basically using the GNU compiler tools
suite.</p>
<p>Even though MingW includes some header files and interface code allowing your
code to interact with the Windows API, as with the regular standard libraries
this doesn't impose licensing restrictions on software you have created.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disadvantages of MinGW</strong></em></p>
<p>Software compiled for Windows using MinGW has to use Windows' own API for file
and IO access. If you are porting a Unix/Linux application to Windows this may
mean significant alteration to the code because the POSIX type API can no
longer be used.</p>
<p><strong>Other considerations</strong></p>
<p>For any non-trivial software application, such as one that uses a graphical
interface, multimedia or accesses devices on the system, you leave the
boundary of what Cygwin can do for you and further work will be needed to make
your code cross-platform. But, this task can be simplified by using cross-
platform toolkits or frameworks that allow coding once and having your code
compile successfully for any platform. If you use such a framework from the
start, you can not only reduce your headaches when it comes time to port to
another platform but you can use the same graphical widgets - windows, menus
and controls - across all platforms if you're writing a GUI app, and have them
appear native to the user.</p>
<p>For instance, the open source Qt framework is a popular and comprehensive
cross-platform development framework, allowing the building of graphical
applications that work across operating systems including windows. There are
other such frameworks too. In addition to the large frameworks there are
thousands of more specialized software libraries in existence which support
multiple platforms allowing you to worry less about writing different code for
different platforms.</p>
<p>When you are developing cross-platform software from the start, you would not
normally have any reason to use Cygwin. When compiled on Windows, you would
usually aim to make your code able to be compiled with either MingW or
Microsoft Visual C/C++, or both. When compiling on Linux/*nix, you'd most
often compile it with the GNU compilers and tools directly.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Cygwin is an attempt to create a complete UNIX/POSIX environment on Windows.
To do this it uses various DLLs. While these DLLs are covered by GPLv3+, their
license contains an exception that does not force a derived work to be covered
by the GPLv3+. MinGW is a C/C++ compiler suite which allows you to create
Windows executables without dependency on such DLLs - you only need the normal
MSVC runtimes, which are part of any normal Microsoft Windows installation.</p>
<p>You can also get a small UNIX/POSIX like environment, compiled with MinGW
called MSYS. It doesn't have anywhere near all the features of Cygwin, but is
ideal for programmers wanting to use MinGW.</p>
