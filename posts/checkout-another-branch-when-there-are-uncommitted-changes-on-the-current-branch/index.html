    <p>Most of the time when I try to checkout another existing branch, Git doesn't
allow me if I have some uncommitted changes on the current branch. So I'll
have to commit or stash those changes first.</p>
<p>However, occasionally Git does allow me to checkout another branch without
committing or stashing those changes, and it will carry those changes to the
branch I checkout.</p>
<p>What is the rule here? Does it matter whether the changes are staged or
unstaged? Carrying the changes to another branch doesn't make any sense to me,
why does git allow it sometimes? That is, is it helpful in some situations?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>Preliminary notes</h4>
<p>This answer is an attempt to explain <em>why</em> Git behaves the way it does. It is
not a recommendation to engage in any particular workflows. (My own preference
is to just commit anyway, avoiding <code>git stash</code> and not trying to be too
tricky, but others like other methods.)</p>
<p>The observation here is that, after you start working in <code>branch1</code> (forgetting
or not realizing that it would be good to switch to a different branch
<code>branch2</code> first), you run:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout branch2
</pre></div>

<p>Sometimes Git says "OK, you're on branch2 now!" Sometimes, Git says "I can't
do that, I'd lose some of your changes."</p>
<p>If Git <em>won't</em> let you do it, you have to commit your changes, to save them
somewhere permanent. <strong>You may want to use<code>git stash</code> to save them; this is
one of the things it's designed for.</strong> Note that <code>git stash save</code> or <code>git
stash push</code> actually <em>means</em> "Commit all the changes, but on no branch at all,
then remove them from where I am now." That makes it possible to switch: you
now have no in-progress changes. You can then <code>git stash apply</code> them after
switching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidebar: <code>git stash save</code> is the old syntax; <code>git stash push</code> was introduced
in Git version 2.13, to fix up some problems with the arguments to <code>git
stash</code> and allow for new options. Both do the same thing, when used in the
basic ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>You can stop reading here, if you like!</h3>
<p>If Git <em>won't</em> let you switch, you already have a remedy: use <code>git stash</code> or
<code>git commit</code>; or, if your changes are trivial to re-create, use <code>git checkout
-f</code> to force it. This answer is all about <em>when</em> Git will let you <code>git
checkout branch2</code> even though you started making some changes. Why does it
work <em>sometimes</em> , and not <em>other</em> times?</p>
<p>The rule here is simple in one way, and complicated/hard-to-explain in
another:</p>
<h4>You may switch branches with uncommitted changes in the work-tree if and</h4>
<p>only if said switching does not require clobbering those changes.</p>
<p>That is—and please note that this is still simplified; there are some extra-
difficult corner cases with staged <code>git add</code>s, <code>git rm</code>s and such—suppose you
are on <code>branch1</code>. A <code>git checkout branch2</code> would have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every file that <em>is</em> in <code>branch1</code> and <em>not</em> in <code>branch2</code>,1 remove that file.</li>
<li>For every file that <em>is</em> in <code>branch2</code> and <em>not</em> in <code>branch1</code>, create that file (with appropriate contents).</li>
<li>For every file that is in both branches, if the version in <code>branch2</code> is different, update the working tree version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these steps could clobber something in your work-tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing a file is "safe" if the version in the work-tree is the same as the committed version in <code>branch1</code>; it's "unsafe" if you've made changes.</li>
<li>Creating a file the way it appears in <code>branch2</code> is "safe" if it does not exist now.2 It's "unsafe" if it does exist now but has the "wrong" contents.</li>
<li>And of course, replacing the work-tree version of a file with a different version is "safe" if the work-tree version is already committed to <code>branch1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a new branch (<code>git checkout -b newbranch</code>) is <em>always</em> considered
"safe": no files will be added, removed, or altered in the work-tree as part
of this process, and the index/staging-area is also untouched. (Caveat: it's
safe when creating a new branch without changing the new branch's starting-
point; but if you add another argument, e.g., <code>git checkout -b newbranch
different-start-point</code>, this might have to change things, to move to
<code>different-start-point</code>. Git will then apply the checkout safety rules as
usual.)</p>
<hr>
<p>1This requires that we define what it means for a file to be in a branch,
which in turn requires defining the word <em>branch</em> properly. (See also What
exactly do we mean by "branch"?) Here, what I really mean is <em>the commit to
which the branch-name resolves:</em> a file whose path is <em><code>P</code></em> <strong>is</strong> in
<code>branch1</code> if <code>git rev-parse branch1: _P_</code> produces a hash. That file <strong>is
not</strong> in <code>branch1</code> if you get an error message instead. The existence of path
<em><code>P</code></em> in your index or work-tree is not relevant when answering this
particular question. Thus, the secret here is to examine the result of <code>git
rev-parse</code> on each <code>_branch-name_ : _path_</code>. This either fails because the
file is "in" at most one branch, or gives us two hash IDs. If the two hash IDs
are <em>the same</em> , the file is the same in both branches. No changing is
required. If the hash IDs differ, the file is different in the two branches,
and must be changed to switch branches.</p>
<p><strong><em>The key notion here is that files in</em> commits <em>are frozen forever. Files
you will edit are obviously</em> not <em>frozen. We are, at least initially, looking
only at the mismatches between two frozen commits.</em></strong> Unfortunately, we—or
Git—also have to deal with files that <em>aren't</em> in the commit you're going to
switch away from and <em>are</em> in the commit you're going to switch to. This leads
to the remaining complications, since files can also exist in the index and/or
in the work-tree, without having to exist these two particular frozen commits
we're working with.</p>
<p>2It might be considered "sort-of-safe" if it already exists with the "right
contents", so that Git does not have to create it after all. I recall at least
some versions of Git allowing this, but testing just now shows it to be
considered "unsafe" in Git 1.8.5.4. The same argument would apply to a
modified file that happens to be modified to match the to-be-switch-to branch.
Again, 1.8.5.4 just says "would be overwritten", though. See the end of the
technical notes as well: my memory may be faulty as I don't think the read-
tree rules have changed since I first started using Git at version
1.5.something.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Does it matter whether the changes are staged or unstaged?</h4>
<p>Yes, in some ways. In particular, you can stage a change, then "de-modify" the
work tree file. Here's a file in two branches, that's different in <code>branch1</code>
and <code>branch2</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>show<span class="w"> </span>branch1:inboth
this<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>is<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span>both<span class="w"> </span>branches
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>show<span class="w"> </span>branch2:inboth
this<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>is<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span>both<span class="w"> </span>branches
but<span class="w"> </span>it<span class="w"> </span>has<span class="w"> </span>more<span class="w"> </span>stuff<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span>branch2<span class="w"> </span>now
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>branch1
Switched<span class="w"> </span>to<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'branch1'</span>
$<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'but it has more stuff in branch2 now'</span><span class="w"> </span>&gt;&gt;<span class="w"> </span>inboth
</pre></div>

<p>At this point, the working tree file <code>inboth</code> matches the one in <code>branch2</code>,
even though we're on <code>branch1</code>. This change is not staged for commit, which is
what <code>git status --short</code> shows here:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status<span class="w"> </span>--short
<span class="w"> </span>M<span class="w"> </span>inboth
</pre></div>

<p>The space-then-M means "modified but not staged" (or more precisely, working-
tree copy differs from staged/index copy).</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>branch2
error:<span class="w"> </span>Your<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">local</span><span class="w"> </span>changes<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>

<p>OK, now let's stage the working-tree copy, which we already know also matches
the copy in <code>branch2</code>.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>add<span class="w"> </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status<span class="w"> </span>--short
M<span class="w">  </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>branch2
Switched<span class="w"> </span>to<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'branch2'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here the staged-and-working copies both matched what was in <code>branch2</code>, so the
checkout was allowed.</p>
<p>Let's try another step:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>branch1
Switched<span class="w"> </span>to<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'branch1'</span>
$<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>inboth
this<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>is<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span>both<span class="w"> </span>branches
</pre></div>

<p>The change I made is lost from the staging area now (because checkout writes
through the staging area). This is a bit of a corner case. The change is not
gone, but the fact that I had staged it, <em>is</em> gone.</p>
<p>Let's stage a third variant of the file, different from either branch-copy,
then set the working copy to match the current branch version:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'staged version different from all'</span><span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>add<span class="w"> </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>show<span class="w"> </span>branch1:inboth<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status<span class="w"> </span>--short
MM<span class="w"> </span>inboth
</pre></div>

<p>The two <code>M</code>s here mean: staged file differs from <code>HEAD</code> file, <em>and</em> , working-
tree file differs from staged file. The working-tree version does match the
<code>branch1</code> (aka <code>HEAD</code>) version:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>diff<span class="w"> </span>HEAD
$
</pre></div>

<p>But <code>git checkout</code> won't allow the checkout:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>branch2
error:<span class="w"> </span>Your<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">local</span><span class="w"> </span>changes<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>

<p>Let's set the <code>branch2</code> version as the working version:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>show<span class="w"> </span>branch2:inboth<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status<span class="w"> </span>--short
MM<span class="w"> </span>inboth
$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>diff<span class="w"> </span>HEAD

</pre></div>

<p>Even though the current working copy matches the one in <code>branch2</code>, the staged
file does not, so a <code>git checkout</code> would lose that copy, and the <code>git
checkout</code> is rejected.</p>
<h4>Technical notes—only for the insanely curious :-)</h4>
<p>The underlying implementation mechanism for all of this is Git's <em>index</em>. The
index, also called the "staging area", is where you build the <em>next</em> commit:
it starts out matching the current commit, i.e., whatever you have checked-out
now, and then each time you <code>git add</code> a file, you <em>replace</em> the index version
with whatever you have in your work-tree.</p>
<p>Remember, the <em>work-tree</em> is where you work on your files. Here, they have
their normal form, rather than some special only-useful-to-Git form like they
do in commits and in the index. So you extract a file <em>from</em> a commit,
<em>through</em> the index, and then on into the work-tree. After changing it, you
<code>git add</code> it to the index. So there are in fact three places for each file:
the current commit, the index, and the work-tree.</p>
<p>When you run <code>git checkout branch2</code>, what Git does underneath the covers is to
compare the <em>tip commit</em> of <code>branch2</code> to whatever is in both the current
commit and the index now. Any file that matches what's there now, Git can
leave alone. It's all untouched. Any file that's the same in both <em>commits</em> ,
Git can <em>also</em> leave alone—and these are the ones that let you switch
branches.</p>
<p>Much of Git, including commit-switching, is relatively fast <em>because of</em> this
index. What's actually in the index is not each file itself, but rather each
file's <em>hash</em>. The copy of the file itself is stored as what Git calls a <em>blob
object</em> , in the repository. This is similar to how the files are stored in
commits as well: commits don't actually contain the <em>files</em> , they just lead
Git to the hash ID of each file. So Git can compare hash IDs—currently
160-bit-long strings—to decide if commits <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> have the <em>same</em> file or
not. It can then compare those hash IDs to the hash ID in the index, too.</p>
<p>This is what leads to all the oddball corner cases above. We have commits <em>X</em>
and <em>Y</em> that both have file <code>path/to/name.txt</code>, and we have an index entry for
<code>path/to/name.txt</code>. Maybe all three hashes match. Maybe two of them match and
one doesn't. Maybe all three are different. And, we might also have
<code>another/file.txt</code> that's only in <em>X</em> or only in <em>Y</em> and is or is not in the
index now. Each of these various cases requires its own separate
consideration: does Git <em>need</em> to copy the file out from commit to index, or
remove it from index, to switch from <em>X</em> to <em>Y</em>? If so, it also <em>has to</em> copy
the file to the work-tree, or remove it from the work-tree. And if <em>that</em> 's
the case, the index and work-tree versions had better match at least one of
the committed versions; otherwise Git will be clobbering some data.</p>
<p>(The complete rules for all of this are described in, not the <code>git checkout</code>
documentation as you might expect, but rather the <code>git read-tree</code>
documentation, under the section titled "Two Tree Merge".)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You have two choices: stash your changes:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git stash
</pre></div>

<p>then later to get them back:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git stash apply
</pre></div>

<p>or put your changes on a branch so you can get the remote branch and then
merge your changes onto it. That's one of the greatest things about git: you
can make a branch, commit to it, then fetch other changes on to the branch you
were on.</p>
<p>You say it doesn't make any sense, but you are only doing it so you can merge
them at will after doing the pull. Obviously your other choice is to commit on
your copy of the branch and then do the pull. The presumption is you either
don't want to do that (in which case I am puzzled that you don't want a
branch) or you are afraid of conflicts.</p>
