    <p>I keep rereading the Docker documentation to try to understand the difference
between Docker and a full VM. How does it manage to provide a full filesystem,
isolated networking environment, etc. without being as heavy?</p>
<p>Why is deploying software to a Docker image (if that's the right term) easier
than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Docker originally used LinuX Containers (LXC), but later switched to runC
(formerly known as <strong>libcontainer</strong> ), which runs in the same operating system
as its host. This allows it to share a lot of the host operating system
resources. Also, it uses a layered filesystem (AuFS) and manages networking.</p>
<p>AuFS is a layered file system, so you can have a read only part and a write
part which are merged together. One could have the common parts of the
operating system as read only (and shared amongst all of your containers) and
then give each container its own mount for writing.</p>
<p>So, let's say you have a 1 GB container image; if you wanted to use a full VM,
you would need to have 1 GB x number of VMs you want. With Docker and AuFS you
can share the bulk of the 1 GB between all the containers and if you have 1000
containers you still might only have a little over 1 GB of space for the
containers OS (assuming they are all running the same OS image).</p>
<p>A full virtualized system gets its own set of resources allocated to it, and
does minimal sharing. You get more isolation, but it is much heavier (requires
more resources). With Docker you get less isolation, but the containers are
lightweight (require fewer resources). So you could easily run thousands of
containers on a host, and it won't even blink. Try doing that with Xen, and
unless you have a really big host, I don't think it is possible.</p>
<p>A full virtualized system usually takes minutes to start, whereas
Docker/LXC/runC containers take seconds, and often even less than a second.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons for each type of virtualized system. If you want full
isolation with guaranteed resources, a full VM is the way to go. If you just
want to isolate processes from each other and want to run a ton of them on a
reasonably sized host, then Docker/LXC/runC seems to be the way to go.</p>
<p>For more information, check out this set of blog posts which do a good job of
explaining how LXC works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is deploying software to a docker image (if that's the right term)
easier than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deploying a consistent production environment is easier said than done. Even
if you use tools like Chef and Puppet, there are always OS updates and other
things that change between hosts and environments.</p>
<p>Docker gives you the ability to snapshot the OS into a shared image, and makes
it easy to deploy on other Docker hosts. Locally, dev, qa, prod, etc.: all the
same image. Sure you can do this with other tools, but not nearly as easily or
fast.</p>
<p>This is great for testing; let's say you have thousands of tests that need to
connect to a database, and each test needs a pristine copy of the database and
will make changes to the data. The classic approach to this is to reset the
database after every test either with custom code or with tools like Flyway -
this can be very time-consuming and means that tests must be run serially.
However, with Docker you could create an image of your database and run up one
instance per test, and then run all the tests in parallel since you know they
will all be running against the same snapshot of the database. Since the tests
are running in parallel and in Docker containers they could run all on the
same box at the same time and should finish much faster. Try doing that with a
full VM.</p>
<p>From comments...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interesting! I suppose I'm still confused by the notion of "snapshot[ting]
the OS". How does one do that without, well, making an image of the OS?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, let's see if I can explain. You start with a base image, and then make
your changes, and commit those changes using docker, and it creates an image.
This image contains only the differences from the base. When you want to run
your image, you also need the base, and it layers your image on top of the
base using a layered file system: as mentioned above, Docker uses AuFS. AuFS
merges the different layers together and you get what you want; you just need
to run it. You can keep adding more and more images (layers) and it will
continue to only save the diffs. Since Docker typically builds on top of
ready-made images from a registry, you rarely have to "snapshot" the whole OS
yourself.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>It might be helpful to understand how virtualization and containers work at a
low level. That will clear up lot of things.</p>
<p>Note: I'm simplifying a bit in the description below. See references for more
information.</p>
<p><strong>How does virtualization work at a low level?</strong></p>
<p>In this case the VM manager takes over the CPU ring 0 (or the "root mode" in
newer CPUs) and intercepts all privileged calls made by the guest OS to create
the illusion that the guest OS has its own hardware. Fun fact: Before 1998 it
was thought to be impossible to achieve this on the x86 architecture because
there was no way to do this kind of interception. The folks at VMware were the
first who had an idea to rewrite the executable bytes in memory for privileged
calls of the guest OS to achieve this.</p>
<p>The net effect is that virtualization allows you to run two completely
different OSes on the same hardware. Each guest OS goes through all the
processes of bootstrapping, loading kernel, etc. You can have very tight
security. For example, a guest OS can't get full access to the host OS or
other guests and mess things up.</p>
<p><strong>How do containers work at a low level?</strong></p>
<p>Around 2006, people including some of the employees at Google implemented a
new kernel level feature called <em>namespaces</em> (however the idea long before
existed in FreeBSD). One function of the OS is to allow sharing of global
resources like network and disks among processes. What if these global
resources were wrapped in namespaces so that they are visible only to those
processes that run in the same namespace? Say, you can get a chunk of disk and
put that in namespace X and then processes running in namespace Y can't see or
access it. Similarly, processes in namespace X can't access anything in memory
that is allocated to namespace Y. Of course, processes in X can't see or talk
to processes in namespace Y. This provides a kind of virtualization and
isolation for global resources. This is how Docker works: Each container runs
in its own namespace but uses exactly the <em>same</em> kernel as all other
containers. The isolation happens because the kernel knows the namespace that
was assigned to the process and during API calls it makes sure that the
process can only access resources in its own namespace.</p>
<p>The limitations of containers vs VMs should be obvious now: You can't run
completely different OSes in containers like in VMs. However you <em>can</em> run
different distros of Linux because they do share the same kernel. The
isolation level is not as strong as in a VM. In fact, there was a way for a
"guest" container to take over the host in early implementations. Also you can
see that when you load a new container, an entire new copy of the OS doesn't
start like it does in a VM. All containers share the same kernel. This is why
containers are light weight. Also unlike a VM, you don't have to pre-allocate
a significant chunk of memory to containers because we are not running a new
copy of the OS. This enables running thousands of containers on one OS while
sandboxing them, which might not be possible if we were running separate
copies of the OS in their own VMs.</p>
