    <p>I know <code>pip</code> is a package manager for python packages. However, I saw the
installation on IPython's website use <code>conda</code> to install IPython.</p>
<p>Can I use <code>pip</code> to install IPython? Why should I use <code>conda</code> as another python
package manager when I already have <code>pip</code>?</p>
<p>What is the difference between <code>pip</code> and <code>conda</code>?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Quoting from the Conda blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having been involved in the python world for so long, we are all aware of
pip, easy_install, and virtualenv, but these tools did not meet all of our
specific requirements. The main problem is that they are focused around
Python, neglecting non-Python library dependencies, such as HDF5, MKL, LLVM,
etc., which do not have a setup.py in their source code and also do not
install files into Python’s site-packages directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Conda is a packaging tool and installer that aims to do more than what
<code>pip</code> does; handle library dependencies <em>outside</em> of the Python packages as
well as the Python packages themselves. Conda also creates a virtual
environment, like <code>virtualenv</code> does.</p>
<p>As such, Conda should be compared to Buildout perhaps, another tool that lets
you handle both Python and non-Python installation tasks.</p>
<p>Because Conda introduces a new packaging format, you cannot use <code>pip</code> and
Conda interchangeably; <code>pip</code> cannot install the Conda package format. You can
use the two tools side by side (by installing <code>pip</code> with <code>conda install pip</code>)
but they do not interoperate either.</p>
<p>Since writing this answer, Anaconda has published a new page on <em>Understanding
Conda and Pip</em> , which echoes this as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This highlights a key difference between conda and pip. Pip installs Python
packages whereas conda installs packages which may contain software written
in any language. For example, before using pip, a Python interpreter must be
installed via a system package manager or by downloading and running an
installer. Conda on the other hand can install Python packages as well as
the Python interpreter directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and further on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally a package is needed which is not available as a conda package
but is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip. In these cases, it
makes sense to try to use both conda and pip.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> : This answer describes the state of things as it was a decade
ago, at that time pip did not support binary packages. Conda was specifically
created to better support building and distributing binary packages, in
particular data science libraries with C extensions. For reference, pip only
gained widespread support for portable binary packages with wheels (pip 1.4 in
2013) and the manylinux1 specification (pip 8.1 in March 2016). See the more
recent answer for more history.</p>
<p>Here is a short rundown:</p>
<h3>pip</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python packages only.</li>
<li>Compiles everything from source. <strong>EDIT: pip now installs binary wheels, if they are available.</strong>
</li>
<li>Blessed by the core Python community (i.e., Python 3.4+ includes code that automatically bootstraps pip).</li>
</ul>
<h3>conda</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python agnostic. The main focus of existing packages are for Python, and indeed Conda itself is written in Python, but you can also have Conda packages for C libraries, or R packages, or really anything.</li>
<li>Installs binaries. There is a tool called <code>conda build</code> that builds packages from source, but <code>conda install</code> itself installs things from already built Conda packages.</li>
<li>External. conda is an environment and package manager. It is included in the Anaconda Python distribution provided by Continuum Analytics (now called Anaconda, Inc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>conda is an environment manager written in Python and is language-agnostic.
conda environment management functions cover the functionality provided by
venv, virtualenv, pipenv, pyenv, and other Python-specific package managers.
You could use conda within an existing Python installation by pip installing
it (though this is not recommended unless you have a good reason to use an
existing installation). As of 2022, conda and pip are not fully aware of one
another package management activities within a virtual environment, not are
they interoperable for Python package management.</p>
<p>In both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written in Python</li>
<li>Open source (conda is BSD and pip is MIT)</li>
<li>Warning: While conda itself is open-source, the package repositories are hosted by Anaconda Inc and have restrictions around commercial usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two bullet points of conda are really what make it advantageous over
pip for many packages. Since pip installs from source, it can be painful to
install things with it if you are unable to compile the source code (this is
especially true on Windows, but it can even be true on Linux if the packages
have some difficult C or FORTRAN library dependencies). conda installs from
binary, meaning that someone (e.g., Continuum) has already done the hard work
of compiling the package, and so the installation is easy.</p>
<p>There are also some differences if you are interested in building your own
packages. For instance, pip is built on top of setuptools, whereas conda uses
its own format, which has some advantages (like being static, and again,
Python agnostic).</p>
