<h2>Answer</h2>
<h3>JavaBeans</h3>
<p>A JavaBean is a class that follows the JavaBeans conventions as defined by
Sun. Wikipedia has a pretty good summary of what JavaBeans are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaBeans are reusable software components for Java that can be manipulated
visually in a builder tool. Practically, they are classes written in the
Java programming language conforming to a particular convention. They are
used to encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean), so that
they can be passed around as a single bean object instead of as multiple
individual objects. A JavaBean is a Java Object that is serializable, has a
nullary constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter
methods.</p>
<p>In order to function as a JavaBean class, an object class must obey certain
conventions about method naming, construction, and behavior. These
conventions make it possible to have tools that can use, reuse, replace, and
connect JavaBeans.</p>
<p>The required conventions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The class must have a public default constructor. This allows easy
instantiation within editing and activation frameworks.</li>
<li>The class properties must be accessible using get, set, and other
methods (so-called accessor methods and mutator methods), following a
standard naming convention. This allows easy automated inspection and
updating of bean state within frameworks, many of which include custom
editors for various types of properties.</li>
<li>The class should be serializable. This allows applications and
frameworks to reliably save, store, and restore the bean's state in a
fashion that is independent of the VM and platform.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these requirements are largely expressed as conventions rather than
by implementing interfaces, some developers view JavaBeans as Plain Old Java
Objects that follow specific naming conventions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>POJO</h3>
<p>A Plain Old Java Object or POJO is a term initially introduced to designate a
simple lightweight Java object, not implementing any <code>javax.ejb</code> interface, as
opposed to heavyweight EJB 2.x (especially Entity Beans, Stateless Session
Beans are not that bad IMO). Today, the term is used for any simple object
with no extra stuff. Again, Wikipedia does a good job at defining POJO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>POJO is an acronym for Plain Old Java Object. The name is used to emphasize
that the object in question is an ordinary Java Object, not a special
object, and in particular not an Enterprise JavaBean (especially before EJB
3). The term was coined by Martin Fowler, Rebecca Parsons and Josh MacKenzie
in September 2000:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We wondered why people were so against using regular objects in their
systems and concluded that it was because simple objects lacked a fancy name.
So we gave them one, and it's caught on very nicely."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term continues the pattern of older terms for technologies that do not
use fancy new features, such as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) in
telephony, and PODS (Plain Old Data Structures) that are defined in C++ but
use only C language features, and POD (Plain Old Documentation) in Perl.</p>
<p>The term has most likely gained widespread acceptance because of the need
for a common and easily understood term that contrasts with complicated
object frameworks. A JavaBean is a POJO that is serializable, has a no-
argument constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and
setter methods. An Enterprise JavaBean is not a single class but an entire
component model (again, EJB 3 reduces the complexity of Enterprise
JavaBeans).</p>
<p>As designs using POJOs have become more commonly-used, systems have arisen
that give POJOs some of the functionality used in frameworks and more choice
about which areas of functionality are actually needed. Hibernate and Spring
are examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Value Object</h3>
<p>A Value Object or VO is an object such as <code>java.lang.Integer</code> that hold values
(hence value objects). For a more formal definition, I often refer to Martin
Fowler's description of Value Object:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture I described Value Object
as a small object such as a Money or date range object. Their key property
is that they follow value semantics rather than reference semantics.</p>
<p>You can usually tell them because their notion of equality isn't based on
identity, instead two value objects are equal if all their fields are equal.
Although all fields are equal, you don't need to compare all fields if a
subset is unique - for example currency codes for currency objects are
enough to test equality.</p>
<p>A general heuristic is that value objects should be entirely immutable. If
you want to change a value object you should replace the object with a new
one and not be allowed to update the values of the value object itself -
updatable value objects lead to aliasing problems.</p>
<p>Early J2EE literature used the term value object to describe a different
notion, what I call a Data Transfer Object. They have since changed their
usage and use the term Transfer Object instead.</p>
<p>You can find some more good material on value objects on the wiki and by
Dirk Riehle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Data Transfer Object</h3>
<p>Data Transfer Object or DTO is a (anti) pattern introduced with EJB. Instead
of performing many remote calls on EJBs, the idea was to encapsulate data in a
value object that could be transfered over the network: a Data Transfer
Object. Wikipedia has a decent definition of Data Transfer Object:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data transfer object (DTO), formerly known as value objects or VO, is a
design pattern used to transfer data between software application
subsystems. DTOs are often used in conjunction with data access objects to
retrieve data from a database.</p>
<p>The difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data
access objects is that a DTO does not have any behaviour except for storage
and retrieval of its own data (accessors and mutators).</p>
<p>In a traditional EJB architecture, DTOs serve dual purposes: first, they
work around the problem that entity beans are not serializable; second, they
implicitly define an assembly phase where all data to be used by the view is
fetched and marshalled into the DTOs before returning control to the
presentation tier.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>So, for many people, DTOs and VOs are the same thing (but Fowler uses VOs to
mean something else as we saw). Most of time, they follow the JavaBeans
conventions and are thus JavaBeans too. And all are POJOs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>DTO vs VO</strong></p>
<p><strong>DTO -</strong> Data transfer objects are just data containers which are used to
transport data between layers and tiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It mainly contains attributes. You can even use public attributes without getters and setters. </li>
<li>Data transfer objects do not contain any business logic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong><br>
Simple Registration form with attributes username, password and email id.</p>
<ul>
<li>When this form is submitted in RegistrationServlet file you will get all
the attributes from view layer to business layer where you pass the
attributes to java beans and then to the DAO or the persistence layer.</li>
<li>DTO's helps in transporting the attributes from view layer to business
layer and finally to the persistence layer.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>DTO was mainly used to get data transported across the network efficiently, it
may be even from JVM to another JVM.</p>
<p>DTOs are often <code>java.io.Serializable</code> - in order to transfer data across JVM.</p>
<p><strong>VO -</strong> A Value Object [1][2] represents itself a fixed set of data and is
similar to a Java enum. A Value Object's identity is based on their state
rather than on their object identity and is immutable. A real world example
would be Color.RED, Color.BLUE, SEX.FEMALE etc.</p>
<p><strong>POJO vs JavaBeans</strong></p>
<p>[1] The Java-Beanness of a POJO is that its private attributes are all
accessed via public getters and setters that conform to the JavaBeans
conventions. e.g.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">    private String foo;
    public String getFoo(){...}
    public void setFoo(String foo){...};
</pre></div>

<p>[2] JavaBeans must implement Serializable and have a no-argument constructor,
whereas in POJO does not have these restrictions.</p>
