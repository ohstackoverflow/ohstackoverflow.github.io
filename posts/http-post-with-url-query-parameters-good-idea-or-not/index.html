    <p>I'm designing an API to go over HTTP and I am wondering if using the HTTP POST
command, but with URL query parameters only and no request body, is a good way
to go.</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Good Web design" requires non-idempotent actions to be sent via POST. This is a non-idempotent action.</li>
<li>It is easier to develop and debug this app when the request parameters are present in the URL.</li>
<li>The API is not intended for widespread use.</li>
<li>It seems like making a POST request with no body will take a bit more work, e.g. a <code>Content-Length: 0</code> header must be explicitly added.</li>
<li>It also seems to me that a POST with no body is a bit counter to most developer's and HTTP frameworks' expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any more pitfalls or advantages to sending parameters on a POST
request via the URL query rather than the request body?</p>
<p>Edit: The reason this is under consideration is that the operations are not
idempotent and have side effects other than retrieval. See the HTTP spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than
retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user
agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a
special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly
unsafe action is being requested.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from
error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical requests is
the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE
share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have
side effects, and so are inherently idempotent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>If your action is not idempotent, then you <em>MUST</em> use <code>POST</code>. If you don't,
you're just asking for trouble down the line. <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code>
methods are <em>required</em> to be idempotent. Imagine what would happen in your
application if the client was pre-fetching every possible <code>GET</code> request for
your service – if this would cause side effects visible to the client, then
something's wrong.</p>
<p>I agree that sending a <code>POST</code> with a query string but without a body seems
odd, but I think it can be appropriate in some situations.</p>
<p>Think of the query part of a URL as a command to the resource to limit the
scope of the current request. Typically, query strings are used to sort or
filter a <code>GET</code> request (like <code>?page=1&amp;sort=title</code>) but I suppose it makes
sense on a <code>POST</code> to also limit the scope (perhaps like
<code>?action=delete&amp;id=5</code>).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Everyone is right: stick with POST for non-idempotent requests.</p>
<p>What about using both an URI query string and request content? Well it's valid
HTTP (see note 1), so why not?!</p>
<p>It is also perfectly logical: URLs, including their query string part, are for
<em>locating</em> resources. Whereas HTTP method verbs (POST - and its optional
request content) are for specifying actions, or <em>what to do with</em> resources.
Those should be orthogonal concerns. (But, they are not beautifully orthogonal
concerns for the special case of ContentType=application/x-www-form-
urlencoded, see note 2 below.)</p>
<p>Note 1: HTTP specification (1.1) does not state that query parameters and
content are mutually exclusive for a HTTP server that accepts POST or PUT
requests. So any server is free to accept both. I.e. if you write the server
there's nothing to stop you choosing to accept both (except maybe an
inflexible framework). Generally, the server can interpret query strings
according to whatever rules it wants. It can even interpret them with
conditional logic that refers to other headers like Content-Type too, which
leads to Note 2:</p>
<p>Note 2: if a <em>web browser</em> is the primary way people are accessing your web
application, and <strong>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</strong> is the Content-Type
they are posting, then you <em>should</em> follow the rules for that Content-Type.
And the rules for application/x-www-form-urlencoded are much more specific
(and frankly, unusual): in this case you must interpret the URI as a set of
parameters, and not a resource location. [This is the same point of usefulness
Powerlord raised; that it may be hard to use web forms to POST content to your
server. Just explained a little differently.]</p>
<p>Note 3: what are query strings originally for? RFC 3986 defines HTTP query
strings as an URI part that works as a non-hierarchical way of locating a
resource.</p>
<p>In case readers asking this question wish to ask what is good RESTful
architecture: the RESTful architecture pattern doesn't require URI schemes to
work a specific way. RESTful architecture concerns itself with other
properties of the system, like cacheability of resources, the design of the
resources themselves (their behavior, capabilities, and representations), and
whether idempotence is satisfied. Or in other words, achieving a design which
is highly compatible with HTTP protocol and its set of HTTP method verbs. :-)
(In other words, RESTful architecture is not very presciptive with how the
resources are <em>located</em>.)</p>
<p>Final note: sometimes query parameters get used for yet other things, which
are neither locating resources nor encoding content. Ever seen a query
parameter like 'PUT=true' or 'POST=true'? These are workarounds for browsers
that don't allow you to use PUT and POST methods. While such parameters are
seen as part of the URL query string (on the wire), I argue that they are not
part of the URL's query <em>in spirit</em>.</p>
