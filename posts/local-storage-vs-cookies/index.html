    <p>I want to reduce load times on my websites by moving all cookies into local
storage since they seem to have the same functionality. Are there any
pros/cons (especially performance-wise) in using local storage to replace
cookie functionality except for the obvious compatibility issues?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are primarily for
reading <strong>server-side</strong> , local storage can only be read by the <strong>client-
side</strong>. So the question is, in your app, who needs this data — the client or
the server?</p>
<p>If it's your client (your JavaScript), then by all means switch. You're
wasting bandwidth by sending all the data in each HTTP header.</p>
<p>If it's your server, local storage isn't so useful because you'd have to
forward the data along somehow (with Ajax or hidden form fields or something).
This might be okay if the server only needs a small subset of the total data
for each request.</p>
<p><em><strong>You'll want to leave your session cookie as a cookie either way though.</strong></em></p>
<p>As per the technical difference, and also my understanding:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apart from being an old way of saving data, Cookies give you a limit of <strong>4096</strong> bytes (4095, actually) — it's per cookie. Local Storage is as big as <strong>10MB per domain</strong> — <strong>this Stack Overflow question</strong> also mentions it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>localStorage</code> is an implementation of the <code>Storage</code> Interface. It stores data with <strong>no expiration date</strong> , and gets cleared <strong>only</strong> through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser Cache / Locally Stored Data — unlike cookie expiry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>In the context of JWTs</strong> , Stormpath have written a fairly helpful article
outlining possible ways to store them, and the (dis-)advantages pertaining to
each method.</p>
<p>It also has a short overview of XSS and CSRF attacks, and how you can combat
them.</p>
<p>I've attached some short snippets of the article below, in case their article
is taken offline/their site goes down.</p>
<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Web Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) is accessible through JavaScript
on the same domain. This means that any JavaScript running on your site will
have access to web storage, and because of this can be vulnerable to cross-
site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS in a nutshell is a type of vulnerability
where an attacker can inject JavaScript that will run on your page. Basic
XSS attacks attempt to inject JavaScript through form inputs, where the
attacker puts alert('You are Hacked'); into a form to see if it is run by
the browser and can be viewed by other users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent XSS, the common response is to escape and encode all untrusted
data. But this is far from the full story. In 2015, modern web apps use
JavaScript hosted on CDNs or outside infrastructure. Modern web apps include
3rd party JavaScript libraries for A/B testing, funnel/market analysis, and
ads. We use package managers like Bower to import other peoples’ code into
our apps.</p>
<p>What if only one of the scripts you use is compromised? Malicious JavaScript
can be embedded on the page, and Web Storage is compromised. These types of
XSS attacks can get everyone’s Web Storage that visits your site, without
their knowledge. This is probably why a bunch of organizations advise not to
store anything of value or trust any information in web storage. This
includes session identifiers and tokens.</p>
<p>As a storage mechanism, Web Storage does not enforce any secure standards
during transfer. Whoever reads Web Storage and uses it must do their due
diligence to ensure they always send the JWT over HTTPS and never HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cookies, when used with the HttpOnly cookie flag, are not accessible through
JavaScript, and are immune to XSS. You can also set the Secure cookie flag
to guarantee the cookie is only sent over HTTPS. This is one of the main
reasons that cookies have been leveraged in the past to store tokens or
session data. Modern developers are hesitant to use cookies because they
traditionally required state to be stored on the server, thus breaking
RESTful best practices. Cookies as a storage mechanism do not require state
to be stored on the server if you are storing a JWT in the cookie. This is
because the JWT encapsulates everything the server needs to serve the
request.</p>
<p>However, cookies are vulnerable to a different type of attack: cross-site
request forgery (CSRF). A CSRF attack is a type of attack that occurs when a
malicious web site, email, or blog causes a user’s web browser to perform an
unwanted action on a trusted site on which the user is currently
authenticated. This is an exploit of how the browser handles cookies. A
cookie can only be sent to the domains in which it is allowed. By default,
this is the domain that originally set the cookie. The cookie will be sent
for a request regardless of whether you are on galaxies.com or
hahagonnahackyou.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern browsers support the <code>SameSite</code> flag, in addition to <code>HttpOnly</code> and
<code>Secure</code>. The purpose of this flag is to prevent the cookie from being
transmitted in cross-site requests, preventing many kinds of CSRF attack.</p>
<p>For browsers that do not support <code>SameSite</code>, CSRF can be prevented by using
synchronized token patterns. This sounds complicated, but all modern web
frameworks have support for this.</p>
<p>For example, AngularJS has a solution to validate that the cookie is
accessible by only your domain. Straight from AngularJS docs:</p>
<p>When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie
(by default, XSRF-TOKEN) and sets it as an HTTP header (X-XSRF-TOKEN). Since
only JavaScript that runs on your domain can read the cookie, your server
can be assured that the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. You
can make this CSRF protection stateless by including a <code>xsrfToken</code> JWT
claim:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"iss"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"http://galaxies.com"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"exp"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1300819380</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"scopes"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">"explorer", "solar-harvester", "seller"</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"sub"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"tom@andromeda.com"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"xsrfToken"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"d9b9714c-7ac0-42e0-8696-2dae95dbc33e"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Leveraging your web app framework’s CSRF protection makes cookies rock solid
for storing a JWT. CSRF can also be partially prevented by checking the HTTP
Referer and Origin header from your API. CSRF attacks will have Referer and
Origin headers that are unrelated to your application.</p>
