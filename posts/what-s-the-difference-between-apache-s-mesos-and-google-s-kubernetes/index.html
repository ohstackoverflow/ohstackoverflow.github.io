    <p>What exactly is the difference between Apache's Mesos and Google's Kubernetes?
I understand both are server cluster management software. Can anyone elaborate
where the main differences are - when would which framework be preferred?</p>
<p>Why would you want to use Kubernetes on top of Mesosphere?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Kubernetes is an open source project that brings 'Google style' cluster
management capabilities to the world of virtual machines, or 'on the metal'
scenarios. It works very well with modern operating system environments (like
CoreOS or Red Hat Atomic) that offer up lightweight computing 'nodes' that are
managed for you. It is written in Golang and is lightweight, modular, portable
and extensible. We (the Kubernetes team) are working with a number of
different technology companies (including Mesosphere who curate the Mesos open
source project) to establish Kubernetes as the standard way to interact with
computing clusters. The idea is to reproduce the patterns that we see people
needing to build cluster applications based on our experience at Google. Some
of these concepts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>pods</em> — a way to group containers together</li>
<li>
<em>replication controllers</em> — a way to handle the lifecycle of containers</li>
<li>
<em>labels</em> — a way to find and query containers, and</li>
<li>
<em>services</em> — a set of containers performing a common function. </li>
</ul>
<p>So with Kubernetes alone you will have something that is simple, easy to get
up-and-running, portable and extensible that adds 'cluster' as a noun to the
things that you manage in the lightest weight manner possible. Run an
application on a cluster, and stop worrying about an individual machine. In
this case, cluster is a flexible resource just like a VM. It is a logical
computing unit. Turn it up, use it, resize it, turn it down quickly and
easily.</p>
<p>With Mesos, there is a fair amount of overlap in terms of the basic vision,
but the products are at quite different points in their lifecycle and have
different sweet spots. Mesos is a distributed systems kernel that stitches
together a lot of different machines into a logical computer. It was born for
a world where you own a lot of physical resources to create a big static
computing cluster. The great thing about it is that lots of modern scalable
data processing application run well on Mesos (Hadoop, Kafka, Spark) and it is
nice because you can run them all on the same basic resource pool, along with
your new age container packaged apps. It is somewhat more heavy weight than
the Kubernetes project, but is getting easier and easier to manage thanks to
the work of folks like Mesosphere.</p>
<p>Now what gets really interesting is that Mesos is currently being adapted to
add a lot of the Kubernetes concepts and to support the Kubernetes API. So it
will be a gateway to getting more capabilities for your Kubernetes app (high
availability master, more advanced scheduling semantics, ability to scale to a
very large number of nodes) if you need them, and is well suited to run
production workloads (Kubernetes is still in an alpha state).</p>
<p>When asked, I tend to say:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kubernetes is a great place to start if you are new to the clustering world; it is the quickest, easiest and lightest way to kick the tires and start experimenting with cluster oriented development. It offers a very high level of portability since it is being supported by a lot of different providers (Microsoft, IBM, Red Hat, CoreOs, MesoSphere, VMWare, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have existing workloads (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, etc), Mesos gives you a framework that let's you interleave those workloads with each other, and mix in a some of the new stuff including Kubernetes apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mesos gives you an escape valve if you need capabilities that are not yet implemented by the community in the Kubernetes framework. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Both projects aim to make it easier to deploy &amp; manage applications inside
containers in your datacenter or cloud.</p>
<p>In order to deploy applications on top of Mesos, one can use Marathon or
Kubernetes for Mesos.</p>
<p>Marathon is a cluster-wide init and control system for running Linux services
in cgroups and Docker containers. Marathon has a number of different canary
deploy features and is a very mature project.</p>
<p>Marathon runs on top of Mesos, which is a highly scalable, battle tested and
flexible resource manager. Marathon is proven to scale and runs in many
production environments.</p>
<p>The Mesos and Mesosphere technology stack provides a cloud-like environment
for running existing Linux workloads, but it also provides a native
environment for building new distributed systems.</p>
<p>Mesos is a distributed systems kernel, with a full API for programming
directly against the datacenter. It abstracts underlying hardware (e.g. bare
metal or VMs) away and just exposes the resources. It contains primitives for
writing distributed applications (e.g. Spark was originally a Mesos App,
Chronos, etc.) such as Message Passing, Task Execution, etc. Thus, entirely
new applications are made possible. Apache Spark is one example for a new (in
Mesos jargon called) framework that was built originally for Mesos. This
enabled really fast development - the developers of Spark didn't have to worry
about networking to distribute tasks amongst nodes as this is a core primitive
in Mesos.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, Kubernetes is not used inside Google in production
deployments today. For production, Google uses Omega/Borg, which is much more
similar to the Mesos/Marathon model. However the great thing about using Mesos
as the foundation is that both Kubernetes and Marathon can run on top of it.</p>
