    <p>I have seen this mentioned a few times and I am not clear on what it means.
When and why would you do this?</p>
<p>I know what interfaces do, but the fact I am not clear on this makes me think
I am missing out on using them correctly.</p>
<p>Is it just so if you were to do:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">IInterface classRef = new ObjectWhatever()
</pre></div>

<p>You could use any class that implements <code>IInterface</code>? When would you need to
do that? The only thing I can think of is if you have a method and you are
unsure of what object will be passed except for it implementing <code>IInterface</code>.
I cannot think how often you would need to do that.</p>
<p>Also, how could you write a method that takes in an object that implements an
interface? Is that possible?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There are some wonderful answers on here to this questions that get into all
sorts of great detail about interfaces and loosely coupling code, inversion of
control and so on. There are some fairly heady discussions, so I'd like to
take the opportunity to break things down a bit for understanding why an
interface is useful.</p>
<p>When I first started getting exposed to interfaces, I too was confused about
their relevance. I didn't understand why you needed them. If we're using a
language like Java or C#, we already have inheritance and I viewed interfaces
as a <em>weaker</em> form of inheritance and thought, "why bother?" In a sense I was
right, you can think of interfaces as sort of a weak form of inheritance, but
beyond that I finally understood their use as a language construct by thinking
of them as a means of classifying common traits or behaviors that were
exhibited by potentially many non-related classes of objects.</p>
<p>For example -- say you have a SIM game and have the following classes:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">HouseFly</span> <span class="n">inherits</span> <span class="n">Insect</span> {
    <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">FlyAroundYourHead</span>(){}
    <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">LandOnThings</span>(){}
}

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Telemarketer</span> <span class="n">inherits</span> <span class="n">Person</span> {
    <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">CallDuringDinner</span>(){}
    <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo</span>(){}
}
</pre></div>

<p>Clearly, these two objects have nothing in common in terms of direct
inheritance. But, you could say they are both annoying.</p>
<p>Let's say our game needs to have some sort of random <em>thing</em> that annoys the
game player when they eat dinner. This could be a <code>HouseFly</code> or a
<code>Telemarketer</code> or both -- but how do you allow for both with a single
function? And how do you ask each different type of object to "do their
annoying thing" in the same way?</p>
<p>The key to realize is that both a <code>Telemarketer</code> and <code>HouseFly</code> share a common
loosely interpreted behavior even though they are nothing alike in terms of
modeling them. So, let's make an interface that both can implement:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">interface IPest {
    void BeAnnoying();
}

class HouseFly inherits Insect implements IPest {
    void FlyAroundYourHead(){}
    void LandOnThings(){}

    void BeAnnoying() {
        FlyAroundYourHead();
        LandOnThings();
    }
}

class Telemarketer inherits Person implements IPest {
    void CallDuringDinner(){}
    void ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo(){}

    void BeAnnoying() {
        CallDuringDinner();
        ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo();
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>We now have two classes that can each be annoying in their own way. And they
do not need to derive from the same base class and share common inherent
characteristics -- they simply need to satisfy the contract of <code>IPest</code> --
that contract is simple. You just have to <code>BeAnnoying</code>. In this regard, we can
model the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">DiningRoom</span> {

    <span class="n">DiningRoom</span>(<span class="n">Person</span>[] <span class="n">diningPeople</span>, <span class="n">IPest</span>[] <span class="n">pests</span>) { ... }

    <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">ServeDinner</span>() {
        <span class="k">when</span> <span class="n">diningPeople</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">eating</span>,

        <span class="n">foreach</span> <span class="n">pest</span> <span class="nb">in</span> <span class="n">pests</span>
        <span class="n">pest</span>.<span class="n">BeAnnoying</span>();
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Here we have a dining room that accepts a number of diners and a number of
pests -- note the use of the interface. This means that in our little world, a
member of the <code>pests</code> array could actually be a <code>Telemarketer</code> object or a
<code>HouseFly</code> object.</p>
<p>The <code>ServeDinner</code> method is called when dinner is served and our people in the
dining room are supposed to eat. In our little game, that's when our pests do
their work -- each pest is instructed to be annoying by way of the <code>IPest</code>
interface. In this way, we can easily have both <code>Telemarketers</code> and
<code>HouseFlys</code> be annoying in each of their own ways -- we care only that we have
something in the <code>DiningRoom</code> object that is a pest, we don't really care what
it is and they could have nothing in common with other.</p>
<p>This very contrived pseudo-code example (that dragged on a lot longer than I
anticipated) is simply meant to illustrate the kind of thing that finally
turned the light on for me in terms of when we might use an interface. I
apologize in advance for the silliness of the example, but hope that it helps
in your understanding. And, to be sure, the other posted answers you've
received here really cover the gamut of the use of interfaces today in design
patterns and development methodologies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The specific example I used to give to students is that they should write</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">List myList = new ArrayList(); // programming to the List interface
</pre></div>

<p>instead of</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ArrayList myList = new ArrayList(); // this is bad
</pre></div>

<p>These look exactly the same in a short program, but if you go on to use
<code>myList</code> 100 times in your program you can start to see a difference. The
first declaration ensures that you only call methods on <code>myList</code> that are
defined by the <code>List</code> interface (so no <code>ArrayList</code> specific methods). If
you've programmed to the interface this way, later on you can decide that you
really need</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">List myList = new TreeList();
</pre></div>

<p>and you only have to change your code in that one spot. You already know that
the rest of your code doesn't do anything that will be broken by changing the
<em>implementation</em> because you programmed to the <em>interface</em>.</p>
<p>The benefits are even more obvious (I think) when you're talking about method
parameters and return values. Take this for example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public ArrayList doSomething(HashMap map);
</pre></div>

<p>That method declaration ties you to two concrete implementations (<code>ArrayList</code>
and <code>HashMap</code>). As soon as that method is called from other code, any changes
to those types probably mean you're going to have to change the calling code
as well. It would be better to program to the interfaces.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public List doSomething(Map map);
</pre></div>

<p>Now it doesn't matter what kind of <code>List</code> you return, or what kind of <code>Map</code> is
passed in as a parameter. Changes that you make inside the <code>doSomething</code>
method won't force you to change the calling code.</p>
