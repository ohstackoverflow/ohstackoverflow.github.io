    <p>I don't understand how to use <code>$scope.$watch</code> and <code>$scope.$apply</code>. The
official documentation isn't helpful.</p>
<p>What I don't understand specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they connected to the DOM?</li>
<li>How can I update DOM changes to the model?</li>
<li>What is the connection point between them?</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried this tutorial, but it takes the understanding of <code>$watch</code> and <code>$apply</code>
for granted.</p>
<p>What do <code>$apply</code> and <code>$watch</code> do, and how do I use them appropriately?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You need to be aware about how AngularJS works in order to understand it.</p>
<h3>Digest cycle and $scope</h3>
<p>First and foremost, AngularJS defines a concept of a so-called <strong>digest
cycle</strong>. This cycle can be considered as a loop, during which AngularJS checks
if there are any changes to all the variables <strong>watched</strong> by all the
<code>$scope</code>s. So if you have <code>$scope.myVar</code> defined in your controller and this
variable was <strong>marked for being watched</strong> , then you are implicitly telling
AngularJS to monitor the changes on <code>myVar</code> in each iteration of the loop.</p>
<p>A natural follow-up question would be: Is everything attached to <code>$scope</code>
being watched? Fortunately, no. If you would watch for changes to every object
in your <code>$scope</code>, then quickly a digest loop would take ages to evaluate and
you would quickly run into performance issues. That is why the AngularJS team
gave us two ways of declaring some <code>$scope</code> variable as being watched (read
below).</p>
<h3>$watch helps to listen for $scope changes</h3>
<p>There are two ways of declaring a <code>$scope</code> variable as being watched.</p>
<ol>
<li>By using it in your template via the expression <code>&lt;span&gt;{{myVar}}&lt;/span&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>By adding it manually via the <code>$watch</code> service</li>
</ol>
<p>Ad 1) This is the most common scenario and I'm sure you've seen it before, but
you didn't know that this has created a watch in the background. Yes, it had!
Using AngularJS directives (such as <code>ng-repeat</code>) can also create implicit
watches.</p>
<p>Ad 2) This is how you create your own <strong>watches</strong>. <code>$watch</code> service helps you
to run some code when some value attached to the <code>$scope</code> has changed. It is
rarely used, but sometimes is helpful. For instance, if you want to run some
code each time 'myVar' changes, you could do the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">function MyController($scope) {

    $scope.myVar = 1;

    $scope.$watch('myVar', function() {
        alert('hey, myVar has changed!');
    });

    $scope.buttonClicked = function() {
        $scope.myVar = 2; // This will trigger $watch expression to kick in
    };
}
</pre></div>

<h3>$apply enables to integrate changes with the digest cycle</h3>
<p>You can think of the <strong><code>$apply</code> function as of an integration mechanism</strong>. You
see, each time you change some <strong>watched variable attached to the<code>$scope</code></strong>
object directly, AngularJS will know that the change has happened. This is
because AngularJS already knew to monitor those changes. So if it happens in
code managed by the framework, the digest cycle will carry on.</p>
<p>However, sometimes you want to <strong>change some value outside of the AngularJS
world</strong> and see the changes propagate normally. Consider this - you have a
<code>$scope.myVar</code> value which will be modified within a jQuery's <code>$.ajax()</code>
handler. This will happen at some point in future. AngularJS can't wait for
this to happen, since it hasn't been instructed to wait on jQuery.</p>
<p>To tackle this, <code>$apply</code> has been introduced. It lets you start the digestion
cycle explicitly. However, you should only use this to migrate some data to
AngularJS (integration with other frameworks), but never use this method
combined with regular AngularJS code, as AngularJS will throw an error then.</p>
<h3>How is all of this related to the DOM?</h3>
<p>Well, you should really follow the tutorial again, now that you know all this.
The digest cycle will make sure that the UI and the JavaScript code stay
synchronised, by evaluating every watcher attached to all <code>$scope</code>s as long as
nothing changes. If no more changes happen in the digest loop, then it's
considered to be finished.</p>
<p>You can attach objects to the <code>$scope</code> object either explicitly in the
Controller, or by declaring them in <code>{{expression}}</code> form directly in the
view.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>In AngularJS, we update our models, and our views/templates update the DOM
"automatically" (via built-in or custom directives).</p>
<p>$apply and $watch, both being Scope methods, are not related to the DOM.</p>
<p>The Concepts page (section "Runtime") has a pretty good explanation of the
$digest loop, $apply, the $evalAsync queue and the $watch list. Here's the
picture that accompanies the text:</p>
<p><img alt="$digest loop" src="../../images/O1iSG.png"></p>
<p>Whatever code has access to a scope – normally controllers and directives
(their link functions and/or their controllers) – can set up a
"watchExpression" that AngularJS will evaluate against that scope. This
evaluation happens whenever AngularJS enters its $digest loop (in particular,
the "$watch list" loop). You can watch individual scope properties, you can
define a function to watch two properties together, you can watch the length
of an array, etc.</p>
<p>When things happen "inside AngularJS" – e.g., you type into a textbox that has
AngularJS two-way databinding enabled (i.e., uses ng-model), an $http callback
fires, etc. – $apply has already been called, so we're inside the "AngularJS"
rectangle in the figure above. All watchExpressions will be evaluated
(possibly more than once – until no further changes are detected).</p>
<p>When things happen "outside AngularJS" – e.g., you used bind() in a directive
and then that event fires, resulting in your callback being called, or some
jQuery registered callback fires – we're still in the "Native" rectangle. If
the callback code modifies anything that any $watch is watching, call $apply
to get into the AngularJS rectangle, causing the $digest loop to run, and
hence AngularJS will notice the change and do its magic.</p>
