    <p>I have a colleague who claims that <code>git pull</code> is harmful, and gets upset
whenever someone uses it.</p>
<p>The <code>git pull</code> command seems to be the canonical way to update your local
repository. Does using <code>git pull</code> create problems? What problems does it
create? Is there a better way to update a git repository?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>By default, <code>git pull</code> creates merge commits which add noise and complexity to
the code history. In addition, <code>pull</code> makes it easy to not think about how
your changes might be affected by incoming changes.</p>
<p>The <code>git pull</code> command is safe so long as it only performs fast-forward
merges. If <code>git pull</code> is configured to only do fast-forward merges and when a
fast-forward merge isn't possible, then Git will exit with an error. This will
give you an opportunity to study the incoming commits, think about how they
might affect your local commits, and decide the best course of action (merge,
rebase, reset, etc.).</p>
<p>With Git 2.0 and newer, you can run:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git config --global pull.ff only
</pre></div>

<p>to alter the default behavior to only fast-forward. With Git versions between
1.6.6 and 1.9.x you'll have to get into the habit of typing:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git pull --ff-only
</pre></div>

<p>However, with all versions of Git, I recommend configuring a <code>git up</code> alias
like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'
</pre></div>

<p>and using <code>git up</code> instead of <code>git pull</code>. I prefer this alias over <code>git pull
--ff-only</code> because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it works with all (non-ancient) versions of Git,</li>
<li>it fetches all upstream branches (not just the branch you're currently working on), and</li>
<li>it cleans out old <code>origin/*</code> branches that no longer exist upstream.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems with <code>git pull</code>
</h3>
<p><code>git pull</code> isn't bad if it is used properly. Several recent changes to Git
have made it easier to use <code>git pull</code> properly, but unfortunately the default
behavior of a plain <code>git pull</code> has several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>it introduces unnecessary nonlinearities in the history</li>
<li>it makes it easy to accidentally reintroduce commits that were intentionally rebased out upstream</li>
<li>it modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways</li>
<li>pausing what you are doing to review someone else's work is annoying with <code>git pull</code>
</li>
<li>it makes it hard to correctly rebase onto the remote branch</li>
<li>it doesn't clean up branches that were deleted in the remote repo</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems are described in greater detail below.</p>
<h4>Nonlinear History</h4>
<p>By default, the <code>git pull</code> command is equivalent to running <code>git fetch</code>
followed by <code>git merge @{u}</code>. If there are unpushed commits in the local
repository, the merge part of <code>git pull</code> creates a merge commit.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently bad about merge commits, but they can be dangerous
and should be treated with respect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge commits are inherently difficult to examine. To understand what a merge is doing, you have to understand the differences to all parents. A conventional diff doesn't convey this multi-dimensional information well. In contrast, a series of normal commits is easy to review.</li>
<li>Merge conflict resolution is tricky, and mistakes often go undetected for a long time because merge commits are difficult to review.</li>
<li>Merges can quietly supersede the effects of regular commits. The code is no longer the sum of incremental commits, leading to misunderstandings about what actually changed.</li>
<li>Merge commits may disrupt some continuous integration schemes (e.g., auto-build only the first-parent path under the assumed convention that second parents point to incomplete works in progress).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there is a time and a place for merges, but understanding when
merges should and should not be used can improve the usefulness of your
repository.</p>
<p>Note that the purpose of Git is to make it easy to share and consume the
evolution of a codebase, not to precisely record history exactly as it
unfolded. (If you disagree, consider the <code>rebase</code> command and why it was
created.) The merge commits created by <code>git pull</code> do not convey useful
semantics to others—they just say that someone else happened to push to the
repository before you were done with your changes. Why have those merge
commits if they aren't meaningful to others and could be dangerous?</p>
<p>It is possible to configure <code>git pull</code> to rebase instead of merge, but this
also has problems (discussed later). Instead, <code>git pull</code> should be configured
to only do fast-forward merges.</p>
<h4>Reintroduction of Rebased-out Commits</h4>
<p>Suppose someone rebases a branch and force pushes it. This generally shouldn't
happen, but it's sometimes necessary (e.g., to remove a 50GiB log file that
was accidentally comitted and pushed). The merge done by <code>git pull</code> will merge
the new version of the upstream branch into the old version that still exists
in your local repository. If you push the result, pitch forks and torches will
start coming your way.</p>
<p>Some may argue that the real problem is force updates. Yes, it's generally
advisable to avoid force pushes whenever possible, but they are sometimes
unavoidable. Developers must be prepared to deal with force updates, because
they will happen sometimes. This means not blindly merging in the old commits
via an ordinary <code>git pull</code>.</p>
<h4>Surprise Working Directory Modifications</h4>
<p>There's no way to predict what the working directory or index will look like
until <code>git pull</code> is done. There might be merge conflicts that you have to
resolve before you can do anything else, it might introduce a 50GiB log file
in your working directory because someone accidentally pushed it, it might
rename a directory you are working in, etc.</p>
<p><code>git remote update -p</code> (or <code>git fetch --all -p</code>) allows you to look at other
people's commits before you decide to merge or rebase, allowing you to form a
plan before taking action.</p>
<h4>Difficulty Reviewing Other People's Commits</h4>
<p>Suppose you are in the middle of making some changes and someone else wants
you to review some commits they just pushed. <code>git pull</code>'s merge (or rebase)
operation modifies the working directory and index, which means your working
directory and index must be clean.</p>
<p>You could use <code>git stash</code> and then <code>git pull</code>, but what do you do when you're
done reviewing? To get back to where you were you have to undo the merge
created by <code>git pull</code> and apply the stash.</p>
<p><code>git remote update -p</code> (or <code>git fetch --all -p</code>) doesn't modify the working
directory or index, so it's safe to run at any time—even if you have staged
and/or unstaged changes. You can pause what you're doing and review someone
else's commit without worrying about stashing or finishing up the commit
you're working on. <code>git pull</code> doesn't give you that flexibility.</p>
<h4>Rebasing onto a Remote Branch</h4>
<p>A common Git usage pattern is to do a <code>git pull</code> to bring in the latest
changes followed by a <code>git rebase @{u}</code> to eliminate the merge commit that
<code>git pull</code> introduced. It's common enough that Git has some configuration
options to reduce these two steps to a single step by telling <code>git pull</code> to
perform a rebase instead of a merge (see the <code>branch.&lt;branch&gt;.rebase</code>,
<code>branch.autosetuprebase</code>, and <code>pull.rebase</code> options).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have an unpushed merge commit that you want to preserve
(e.g., a commit merging a pushed feature branch into <code>master</code>), neither a
rebase-pull (<code>git pull</code> with <code>branch.&lt;branch&gt;.rebase</code> set to <code>true</code>) nor a
merge-pull (the default <code>git pull</code> behavior) followed by a rebase will work.
This is because <code>git rebase</code> eliminates merges (it linearizes the DAG) without
the <code>--preserve-merges</code> option. The rebase-pull operation can't be configured
to preserve merges, and a merge-pull followed by a <code>git rebase -p @{u}</code> won't
eliminate the merge caused by the merge-pull. <strong>Update:</strong> Git v1.8.5 added
<code>git pull --rebase=preserve</code> and <code>git config pull.rebase preserve</code>. These
cause <code>git pull</code> to do <code>git rebase --preserve-merges</code> after fetching the
upstream commits. (Thanks to funkaster for the heads-up!)</p>
<h4>Cleaning Up Deleted Branches</h4>
<p><code>git pull</code> doesn't prune remote tracking branches corresponding to branches
that were deleted from the remote repository. For example, if someone deletes
branch <code>foo</code> from the remote repo, you'll still see <code>origin/foo</code>.</p>
<p>This leads to users accidentally resurrecting killed branches because they
think they're still active.</p>
<h3>A Better Alternative: Use <code>git up</code> instead of <code>git pull</code>
</h3>
<p>Instead of <code>git pull</code>, I recommend creating and using the following <code>git up</code>
alias:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'
</pre></div>

<p>This alias downloads all of the latest commits from all upstream branches
(pruning the dead branches) and tries to fast-forward the local branch to the
latest commit on the upstream branch. If successful, then there were no local
commits, so there was no risk of merge conflict. The fast-forward will fail if
there are local (unpushed) commits, giving you an opportunity to review the
upstream commits before taking action.</p>
<p>This still modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways, but only if
you don't have any local changes. Unlike <code>git pull</code>, <code>git up</code> will never drop
you to a prompt expecting you to fix a merge conflict.</p>
<h4>Another Option: <code>git pull --ff-only --all -p</code>
</h4>
<p>The following is an alternative to the above <code>git up</code> alias:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git config --global alias.up 'pull --ff-only --all -p'
</pre></div>

<p>This version of <code>git up</code> has the same behavior as the previous <code>git up</code> alias,
except:</p>
<ul>
<li>the error message is a bit more cryptic if your local branch isn't configured with an upstream branch</li>
<li>it relies on an undocumented feature (the <code>-p</code> argument, which is passed to <code>fetch</code>) that may change in future versions of Git</li>
</ul>
<h4>If you are running Git 2.0 or newer</h4>
<p>With Git 2.0 and newer you can configure <code>git pull</code> to only do fast-forward
merges by default:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git config --global pull.ff only
</pre></div>

<p>This causes <code>git pull</code> to act like <code>git pull --ff-only</code>, but it still doesn't
fetch all upstream commits or clean out old <code>origin/*</code> branches so I still
prefer <code>git up</code>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>My answer, pulled from the discussion that arose on HackerNews:</p>
<p>I feel tempted to just answer the question using the Betteridge Law of
Headlines: Why is <code>git pull</code> considered harmful? It isn't.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonlinearities aren't intrinsically bad. If they represent the actual history they are ok.</li>
<li>Accidental reintroduction of commits <strong>rebased</strong> upstream is the result of wrongly rewriting history upstream. You can't rewrite history when history is replicated along several repos.</li>
<li>Modifying the working directory is an expected result; of debatable usefulness, namely in the face of the behaviour of hg/monotone/darcs/other_dvcs_predating_git, but again not intrinsically bad.</li>
<li>Pausing to review others' work is needed for a merge, and is again an expected behaviour on git pull. If you do not want to merge, you should use git fetch. Again, this is an idiosyncrasy of git in comparison with previous popular dvcs, but it is expected behaviour and not intrinsically bad. </li>
<li>Making it hard to rebase against a remote branch is good. Don't rewrite history unless you absolutely need to. I can't for the life of me understand this pursuit of a (fake) linear history</li>
<li>Not cleaning up branches is good. Each repo knows what it wants to hold. Git has no notion of master-slave relationships.</li>
</ul>
