<p>?</p>
<p>It's not totally clear to me if the view uses some sort of caching making it
faster compared to a simple query.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Yes</strong> , views <em>can</em> have a clustered index assigned and, when they do,
they'll store temporary results that can speed up resulting queries.</p>
<p>Microsoft's own documentation makes it very clear that Views can improve
performance.</p>
<p>First, most views that people create are <em>simple</em> views and do not use this
feature, and are therefore no different to querying the base tables directly.
Simple views are expanded in place and so <strong>do not directly contribute to
performance improvements</strong> - that much is true. <strong>However,</strong> indexed views
can <em>dramatically</em> improve performance.</p>
<p>Let me go directly to the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a unique clustered index is created on the view, the view's result set
is materialized immediately and persisted in physical storage in the
database, saving the overhead of performing this costly operation at
execution time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, these indexed views can work <em>even when they are not directly
referenced by another query</em> as the optimizer will use them in place of a
table reference when appropriate.</p>
<p>Again, the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The indexed view can be used in a query execution in two ways. The query can
reference the indexed view directly, or, more importantly, the query
optimizer can select the view if it determines that the view can be
substituted for some or all of the query in the lowest-cost query plan. In
the second case, the indexed view is used instead of the underlying tables
and their ordinary indexes. The view does not need to be referenced in the
query for the query optimizer to use it during query execution. This allows
existing applications to benefit from the newly created indexed views
without changing those applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This documentation, as well as charts demonstrating performance improvements,
can be found here.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> the answer has been criticized on the basis that it is the
"index" that provides the performance advantage, not the "View." However, this
is easily refuted.</p>
<p>Let us say that we are a software company in a small country; I'll use
Lithuania as an example. We sell software worldwide and keep our records in a
SQL Server database. We're very successful and so, in a few years, we have
1,000,000+ records. However, we often need to report sales for tax purposes
and we find that we've only sold 100 copies of our software in our home
country. By creating an indexed view of just the Lithuanian records, we get to
keep the records we need in an indexed cache as described in the MS
documentation. When we run our reports for Lithuanian sales in 2008, our query
will search through an index with a depth of just 7 (Log2(100) with some
unused leaves). If we were to do the same without the VIEW and just relying on
an index into the table, we'd have to traverse an index tree with a search
depth of 21!</p>
<p>Clearly, the View itself would provide us with a performance advantage (3x)
over the simple use of the index alone. I've tried to use a real-world example
but you'll note that a simple list of Lithuanian sales would give us an even
greater advantage.</p>
<p>Note that I'm just using a straight b-tree for my example. While I'm fairly
certain that SQL Server uses some variant of a b-tree, I don't know the
details. Nonetheless, the point holds.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> The question has come up about whether an Indexed View just uses
an index placed on the underlying table. That is, to paraphrase: "an indexed
view is just the equivalent of a standard index and it offers nothing new or
unique to a view." If this was true, of course, then the above analysis would
be incorrect! Let me provide a quote from the Microsoft documentation that
demonstrate why I think this criticism is not valid or true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using indexes to improve query performance is not a new concept; however,
indexed views provide additional performance benefits that cannot be
achieved using standard indexes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together with the above quote regarding the persistence of data in physical
storage and other information in the documentation about how indices are
created on Views, I think it is safe to say that an Indexed View is <strong>not</strong>
just a cached SQL Select that happens to use an index defined on the main
table. Thus, I continue to stand by this answer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>Generally speaking, no.</strong> Views are primarily used for convenience and
security, and won't (by themselves) produce any speed benefit.</p>
<p>That said, SQL Server 2000 and above do have a feature called <strong>Indexed
Views</strong> that <em>can</em> greatly improve performance, with a few caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not every view can be made into an indexed view; they have to follow a specific set of guidelines, which (among other restrictions) means you can't include common query elements like <code>COUNT</code>, <code>MIN</code>, <code>MAX</code>, or <code>TOP</code>.</li>
<li>Indexed views use physical space in the database, just like indexes on a table.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article describes additional benefits and limitations of indexed views:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You Can…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The view definition can reference one or more tables in the same
database.</li>
<li>Once the unique clustered index is created, additional nonclustered
indexes can be created against the view.</li>
<li>You can update the data in the underlying tables – including inserts,
updates, deletes, and even truncates.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You Can’t…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The view definition can’t reference other views, or tables in other
databases.</li>
<li>It can’t contain COUNT, MIN, MAX, TOP, outer joins, or a few other
keywords or elements.</li>
<li>You can’t modify the underlying tables and columns. The view is created
with the WITH SCHEMABINDING option.</li>
<li>You can’t always predict what the query optimizer will do. If you’re
using Enterprise Edition, it will automatically consider the unique
clustered index as an option for a query – but if it finds a “better” index,
that will be used. You could force the optimizer to use the index through
the WITH NOEXPAND hint – but be cautious when using any hint.
</li>
</ul>
