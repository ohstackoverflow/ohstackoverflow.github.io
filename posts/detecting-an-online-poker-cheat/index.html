    <p>It recently emerged on a large poker site that some players were possibly able
to see all opponents cards as they played through exploiting a security
vulnerability that was discovered.</p>
<p>A naïve cheater would win at an incredibly fast rate, and these cheats are
caught very quickly usually, and if not caught quickly they are easy to detect
through a quick scan through their hand histories.</p>
<p>The more difficult problem occurs when the cheater exhibits intelligence,
bluffing in spots they are bound to be called in, calling river bets with the
worst hands, the basic premise is that they lose pots on purpose to disguise
their ability to see other players cards, and they win at a reasonably
realistic rate.</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data set of millions of verified and complete information hand histories</li>
<li>Theoretical unlimited computer power</li>
<li>Assume the game No Limit Hold'em, although suggestions on Omaha or limit poker may be beneficial</li>
</ul>
<p>How could we reasonably accurately classify these cheaters? The original 2+2
thread appeals for ideas, and I thought that the SO community might have some
useful suggestions.</p>
<p>It's an interesting problem also because it is current, and has real
application in bettering the world if someone finds a creative solution, as
there is a good chance genuine players will have funds refunded to them when
identified cheaters are discovered.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Plot V$PIP versus winrate of all players with a statistically significant</p>
<h2>hands played. You should see outliers with naked eye. I think that's the</h2>
<p>basic thing to do first.</p>
<p>Then you can plot WTSD vs winrate, winrate at showdown vs winrate without
showdown, %won at showdown vs VPIP.</p>
<p>The stats you choose must be significant statistically. If you know poker, the
above choices make sense.</p>
<p>This is not a job for a machine, outliers are detected by eye.</p>
<p>EDIT: Omaha is much tougher, since it is really variant. There are cases of
unbelievable streaks made by weak players who were not cheating.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I hate to be so blunt, but all the answers on this page with the exception of
@Erwin Smout's are worthless.</p>
<p><code>Statistical analysis is a joke for identifying poker cheats</code><br>
I realize the question allows there to be millions of hands worth of history
available to the system. I'm sure there are players with hand histories this
large, hell, I've probably played this many online hands. But I've also been
playing online for over 10 years. Thats not a small amount of time, and it is
my understanding that two conflicting things are true when it comes to
identifying online poker cheaters: it needs to happen in a small amount of
time, and like any good thief, an online poker cheat is going to take his
stash elsewhere immediately after the taking.</p>
<p>There was a great example of the variance in poker in this paper which was
generated by matching an always raise player versus an always call player
(page 13 of the PDF). Over the course of 100,000 hands, wayyyy more than I
think most people would be willing to play against someone who could see their
cards, the always call player won on average .026 small blinds per hand. I
know this does not sound like much, but assuming stakes of $5-10, that comes
out to $6,500. Maybe someone can help me find the link, but the measured
professional win rate is less not too much larger than this. Please note,
NEITHER of these players was cheating, and the statistically expected
difference over this number of hands is significantly less than what actually
transpired.</p>
<p><code>What online poker players need to understand</code><br>
Poker is gambling. It is a game of skill, because some players are able to
elicit more information from their opponents than their opponents are able to
gather, and that extra information is often as useful as seeing other peoples
cards. Even players who are better players than their typical opponents, will
end up long term losers. If you do not understand this, you're just searching
for witches with statistics in the arbitrarily small number of hands you'll be
playing against any opponent.</p>
<p><code>What can be done?</code><br>
Keeping in mind the question states that cheaters are able to see the other
players cards, you don't need statistical analysis to identify them. There are
only three ways in which that is possible.</p>
<p>First is that the server is sending the information intentionally to clients
which is an obvious security issue and should not be implemented (IMO, even
for moderators). If a site was found allowing this to happen, it is the
player's responsibility to move their funds elsewhere, or refuse to play on
the site until that terrible design decision is rectified. It should also be
the responsibility of the sites to inform their players of the exact steps
that take place during hands played on the site so they have that to make
their decision on when choosing a site in the first place. Security by
obscurity is unpermitable. As for catching the thieves, this information
should be sitting in log files on their servers, which should be regularly
audited for this type of behavior.</p>
<p>Second is that the user has hacked the poker server and they would know about
that in hurry, or else once it is exposed, it is again players responsibility
to determine where to play. In this case, the cheater can be prosecuted in
most countries.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is possible the dealing algorithm has been cracked. This one was a
major problem in the past with companies that used naive methods to deal
hands, but most of the major shops solved this problem by taking random inputs
from players logged into their system as well as using entropy generating
hardware to seed their random number generator. Thats not to say it cannot be
cracked however. If this is the case, the only option is for the company to
engineer a new random number generator.</p>
