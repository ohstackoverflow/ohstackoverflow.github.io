    <p>First of all, some definitions:</p>
<p>PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing
resource, the enclosed entity <strong>SHOULD be considered as a modified version
of the one residing on the origin server</strong>. If the Request-URI does not
point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a
new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the
resource with that URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PATCH method requests that <strong>a set of changes</strong> described in the request
entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request- URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.</p>
<p>Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to <code>/users</code> with the
data <code>{username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code> and the server
is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource
location (lets assume <code>/users/1</code>) and any next call to GET <code>/users/1</code> will
return <code>{id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code>.</p>
<p>Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered "a
set of changes" and therefore I should PATCH <code>/users/1</code> with "patch document".
In my case it would be the JSON document: <code>{email:
'skwee357@newdomain.example'}</code>. The server then returns 200 (assuming
permission are ok). This brings me to first question:</p>
<ul>
<li>PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?</li>
</ul>
<p>PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to
solve the problem of "patching" or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was
introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was
introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings
me to my second (and the main) question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to <strong>replace</strong> entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. <code>/users</code> to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : When I first spent time reading about REST, idempotence was a
confusing concept to try to get right. I still didn't get it quite right in my
original answer, as further comments (and Jason Hoetger's answer) have shown.
For a while, I have resisted updating this answer extensively, to avoid
effectively plagiarizing Jason, but I'm editing it now because, well, I was
asked to (in the comments).</p>
<p>After reading my answer, I suggest you also read Jason Hoetger's excellent
answer to this question, and I will try to make my answer better without
simply stealing from Jason.</p>
<h3>Why is PUT idempotent?</h3>
<p>As you noted in your RFC 2616 citation, PUT is considered idempotent. When you
PUT a resource, these two assumptions are in play:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are referring to an entity, not to a collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entity you are supplying is complete (the <em>entire</em> entity).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at one of your examples.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"username"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"email"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357@domain.example"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you POST this document to <code>/users</code>, as you suggest, then you might get back
an entity such as</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">##</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">users</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"username"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="ss">"email"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357@domain.example"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you want to modify this entity later, you choose between PUT and PATCH. A
PUT might look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PUT /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can accomplish the same using PATCH. That might look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You'll notice a difference right away between these two. The PUT included all
of the parameters on this user, but PATCH only included the one that was being
modified (<code>email</code>).</p>
<p>When using PUT, it is assumed that you are sending the complete entity, and
that complete entity <em>replaces</em> any existing entity at that URI. In the above
example, the PUT and PATCH accomplish the same goal: they both change this
user's email address. But PUT handles it by replacing the entire entity, while
PATCH only updates the fields that were supplied, leaving the others alone.</p>
<p>Since PUT requests include the entire entity, if you issue the same request
repeatedly, it should always have the same outcome (the data you sent is now
the entire data of the entity). Therefore PUT is idempotent.</p>
<h3>Using PUT wrong</h3>
<p>What happens if you use the above PATCH data in a PUT request?</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@domain.example"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">PUT /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"      // new email address... and nothing else!</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>(I'm assuming for the purposes of this question that the server doesn't have
any specific required fields, and would allow this to happen... that may not
be the case in reality.)</p>
<p>Since we used PUT, but only supplied <code>email</code>, now that's the only thing in
this entity. This has resulted in data loss.</p>
<p>This example is here for illustrative purposes -- don't ever actually do this
(unless your intent is to drop the omitted fields, of course... then you are
using PUT as it should be used). This PUT request is technically idempotent,
but that doesn't mean it isn't a terrible, broken idea.</p>
<h3>How can PATCH be idempotent?</h3>
<p>In the above example, PATCH <em>was</em> idempotent. You made a change, but if you
made the same change again and again, it would always give back the same
result: you changed the email address to the new value.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@domain.example"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // email address was changed</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address... again</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="err">GET /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    "username": "skwee357",</span>
<span class="err">    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // nothing changed since last GET</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>My original example, fixed for accuracy</h3>
<p>I originally had examples that I thought were showing non-idempotency, but
they were misleading / incorrect. I am going to keep the examples, but use
them to illustrate a different thing: that multiple PATCH documents against
the same entity, modifying different attributes, do not make the PATCHes non-
idempotent.</p>
<p>Let's say that at some past time, a user was added. This is the state that you
are starting from.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"id"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"name"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"Sam Kwee"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"email"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"skwee357@olddomain.example"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"address"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"123 Mockingbird Lane"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"city"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"New York"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"state"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"NY"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="ss">"zip"</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"10001"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>After a PATCH, you have a modified entity:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{"email": "skwee357@newdomain.example"}</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">  "id": 1,</span>
<span class="err">  "name": "Sam Kwee",</span>
<span class="err">  "email": "skwee357@newdomain.example",    // the email changed, yay!</span>
<span class="err">  "address": "123 Mockingbird Lane",</span>
<span class="err">  "city": "New York",</span>
<span class="err">  "state": "NY",</span>
<span class="err">  "zip": "10001"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you then repeatedly apply your PATCH, you will continue to get the same
result: the email was changed to the new value. A goes in, A comes out,
therefore this is idempotent.</p>
<p>An hour later, after you have gone to make some coffee and take a break,
someone else comes along with their own PATCH. It seems the Post Office has
been making some changes.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{"zip": "12345"}</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">  "id": 1,</span>
<span class="err">  "name": "Sam Kwee",</span>
<span class="err">  "email": "skwee357@newdomain.example",  // still the new email you set</span>
<span class="err">  "address": "123 Mockingbird Lane",</span>
<span class="err">  "city": "New York",</span>
<span class="err">  "state": "NY",</span>
<span class="err">  "zip": "12345"                      // and this change as well</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Since this PATCH from the post office doesn't concern itself with email, only
zip code, if it is repeatedly applied, it will also get the same result: the
zip code is set to the new value. A goes in, A comes out, therefore this is
<em>also</em> idempotent.</p>
<p>The next day, you decide to send your PATCH again.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users/1</span>
<span class="err">{"email": "skwee357@newdomain.example"}</span>

<span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">  "id": 1,</span>
<span class="err">  "name": "Sam Kwee",</span>
<span class="err">  "email": "skwee357@newdomain.example",</span>
<span class="err">  "address": "123 Mockingbird Lane",</span>
<span class="err">  "city": "New York",</span>
<span class="err">  "state": "NY",</span>
<span class="err">  "zip": "12345"</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Your patch has the same effect it had yesterday: it set the email address. A
went in, A came out, therefore this is idempotent as well.</p>
<h3>What I got wrong in my original answer</h3>
<p>I want to draw an important distinction (something I got wrong in my original
answer). Many servers will respond to your REST requests by sending back the
new entity state, with your modifications (if any). So, when you get this
<em>response</em> back, it is different <em>from the one you got back yesterday</em> ,
because the zip code is not the one you received last time. However, your
request was not concerned with the zip code, only with the email. So your
PATCH document is still idempotent - the email you sent in PATCH is now the
email address on the entity.</p>
<h3>So when is PATCH not idempotent, then?</h3>
<p>For a full treatment of this question, I again refer you to Jason Hoetger's
answer which already fully answers that.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Though Dan Lowe's excellent answer very thoroughly answered the OP's question
about the difference between PUT and PATCH, its answer to the question of why
PATCH is not idempotent is not quite correct.</p>
<p>To show why PATCH isn't idempotent, it helps to start with the definition of
idempotence (from Wikipedia):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term idempotent is used more comprehensively to describe an operation
that will produce the same results if executed once or multiple times [...]
An idempotent function is one that has the property f(f(x)) = f(x) for any
value x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In more accessible language, an idempotent PATCH could be defined as: After
PATCHing a resource with a patch document, all subsequent PATCH calls to the
same resource with the same patch document will not change the resource.</p>
<p>Conversely, a non-idempotent operation is one where f(f(x)) != f(x), which for
PATCH could be stated as: After PATCHing a resource with a patch document,
subsequent PATCH calls to the same resource with the same patch document
<strong>do</strong> change the resource.</p>
<p>To illustrate a non-idempotent PATCH, suppose there is a /users resource, and
suppose that calling <code>GET /users</code> returns a list of users, currently:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">{ "id": 1, "username": "firstuser", "email": "firstuser@example.org" }</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Rather than PATCHing /users/{id}, as in the OP's example, suppose the server
allows PATCHing /users. Let's issue this PATCH request:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">PATCH /users</span>
<span class="err">[{ "op": "add", "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" }]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Our patch document instructs the server to add a new user called <code>newuser</code> to
the list of users. After calling this the first time, <code>GET /users</code> would
return:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">{ "id": 1, "username": "firstuser", "email": "firstuser@example.org" },</span>
<span class="n"> { "id": 2, "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" }</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, if we issue the <em>exact same</em> PATCH request as above, what happens? (For
the sake of this example, let's assume that the /users resource allows
duplicate usernames.) The "op" is "add", so a new user is added to the list,
and a subsequent <code>GET /users</code> returns:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">{ "id": 1, "username": "firstuser", "email": "firstuser@example.org" },</span>
<span class="n"> { "id": 2, "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" },</span>
<span class="n"> { "id": 3, "username": "newuser", "email": "newuser@example.org" }</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The /users resource has changed <em>again</em> , even though we issued the <em>exact
same</em> PATCH against the <em>exact same</em> endpoint. If our PATCH is f(x), f(f(x))
is not the same as f(x), and therefore, <strong>this particular PATCH is not
idempotent</strong>.</p>
<p>Although PATCH isn't <em>guaranteed</em> to be idempotent, there's nothing in the
PATCH specification to prevent you from making all PATCH operations on your
particular server idempotent. RFC 5789 even anticipates advantages from
idempotent PATCH requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also
helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the
same resource in a similar time frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Dan's example, his PATCH operation is, in fact, idempotent. In that
example, the /users/1 entity changed between our PATCH requests, but not
<em>because of</em> our PATCH requests; it was actually the Post Office's <em>different</em>
patch document that caused the zip code to change. The Post Office's different
PATCH is a different operation; if our PATCH is f(x), the Post Office's PATCH
