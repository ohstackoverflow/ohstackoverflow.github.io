    <p>I'm in need of some clarification. I've been reading about REST, and building
RESTful applications. According to wikipedia, REST itself is defined to be
<em>Representational State Transfer</em>. I therefore don't understand all this
stateless <em>gobbledeygook</em> that everyone keeps spewing.</p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At any particular time, a client can either be in transition between
application states or "at rest". A client in a rest state is able to
interact with its user, but creates no load and consumes no per-client
storage on the set of servers or on the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are they just saying don't use session/application level data store???</p>
<p>I get that one goal of REST is to make URI access consistent and available,
for instance, instead of hiding paging requests inside posts, making the page
number of a request a part of the GET URI. Makes sense to me. But it seems
like it is just going overboard saying that <em>no per client data</em> (session
data) should ever be stored server side.</p>
<p>What if I had a queue of messages, and my user wanted to read the messages,
but as he read them, wanted to block certain senders messages coming through
for the duration of his session? Wouldn't it make sense to store this in a
place on the server side, and have the server only send messages (or message
ID's) that were not blocked by the user?</p>
<p>Do I really have to send the entire list of message senders to block each time
I request the new message list? The message list pertinent to me
wouldn't/shouldn't even be a publicly available resource in the first place..</p>
<p>Again, just trying to understand this. Someone <em>please</em> clarify.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>I have found a stack overflow question that has an answer that doesn't quite
get me all the way there: How to manage state in REST which says that the
client state that is important <em>should</em> all be transferred on every
request.... Ugg.. seems like a lot of overhead... Is this right??</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>The fundamental explanation is:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>No client session state on the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By stateless it means that the <strong>server</strong> does not store any state about the
<strong>client session</strong> on the server side.</p>
<p>The <em>client session</em> is stored on the client. The server is stateless means
that every server can service any client at any time, there is no <em>session
affinity</em> or <em>sticky sessions</em>. The relevant session information is stored on
the client and passed to the server as needed.</p>
<p>That does not preclude other services that the web server talks to from
maintaining state about business objects such as shopping carts, just not
about the client's current application/session state.</p>
<p>The <strong>client's</strong> application state should never be stored on the server, but
passed around from the <strong>client</strong> to every place that needs it.</p>
<p>That is where the <em>ST</em> in <em>REST</em> comes from, <em>State Transfer</em>. You transfer
the state around instead of having the server store it. <strong>This is the only way
to scale to millions of concurrent users.</strong> If for no other reason than
because millions of sessions is millions of sessions.</p>
<p>The load of session management is amortized across all the clients, the
clients store their session state and the servers can service many orders of
magnitude or more clients in a stateless fashion.</p>
<p>Even for a service that you think will <em>only</em> need in the 10's of thousands of
concurrent users, you still should make your service stateless. Tens of
thousands is still tens of thousands and there will be time and space cost
associated with it.</p>
<p>Stateless is how the HTTP protocol and the web in general was designed to
operate and is an overall simpler implementation and you have a single code
path instead of a bunch of server side logic to maintain a bunch of session
state.</p>
<h4>There are some very basic implementation principles:</h4>
<p>These are principles not implementations, how you meet these principles may
vary.</p>
<p>In summary, the five key principles are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give every “thing” an ID</li>
<li>Link things together</li>
<li>Use standard methods</li>
<li>Resources with multiple representations</li>
<li>Communicate statelessly</li>
</ol>
<h4>There is nothing about authentication or authorization in the REST</h4>
<p>dissertation.</p>
<p>Because there is nothing different from authenticating a request that is
RESTful from one that is not. Authentication is irrelevant to the RESTful
discussion.</p>
<p>Explaining how to create a stateless application for your particular
requirements, is <em>too-broad</em> for StackOverflow.</p>
<p>Implementing Authentication and Authorization as it pertains to REST is even
more so <em>too-broad</em> and various approaches to implementations are explained in
great detail on the internet in general.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation.
When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all the information
necessary for the server to fulfill that request. The server never relies on
information from previous requests. If that information was important, the
client would have to send it again in subsequent request. Statelessness also
brings new features. It’s easier to distribute a stateless application across
load-balanced servers. A stateless application is also easy to cache.</p>
<p>There are actually two kinds of state. Application State that lives on the
client and Resource State that lives on the server.</p>
<p>A web service only needs to care about your application state when you’re
actually making a request. The rest of the time, it doesn’t even know you
exist. This means that whenever a client makes a request, it must include all
the application states the server will need to process it.</p>
<p>Resource state is the same for every client, and its proper place is on the
server. When you upload a picture to a server, you create a new resource: the
new picture has its own URI and can be the target of future requests. You can
fetch, modify, and delete this resource through HTTP.</p>
