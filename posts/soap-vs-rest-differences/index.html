    <p>I have read articles about the differences between SOAP and REST as a web
service communication protocol, but I think that the biggest advantages for
REST over SOAP are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>REST is more dynamic, no need to create and update UDDI(Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST is not restricted to only XML format. RESTful web services can send plain text/JSON/XML.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But SOAP is more standardized (E.g.: security).</p>
<p>So, am I correct in these points?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of misinformation and misconceptions around
REST. Not only your question and the answer by @cmd reflect those, but most of
the questions and answers related to the subject on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>SOAP and REST can't be compared directly, since the first is a protocol (or at
least tries to be) and the second is an architectural style. This is probably
one of the sources of confusion around it, since people tend to call REST any
HTTP API that isn't SOAP.</p>
<p>Pushing things a little and trying to establish a comparison, the main
difference between SOAP and REST is the degree of coupling between client and
server implementations. A SOAP client works like a custom desktop application,
tightly coupled to the server. There's a rigid contract between client and
server, and everything is expected to break if either side changes anything.
You need constant updates following any change, but it's easier to ascertain
if the contract is being followed.</p>
<p>A REST client is more like a browser. It's a generic client that knows how to
use a protocol and standardized methods, and an application has to fit inside
that. You don't violate the protocol standards by creating extra methods, you
leverage on the standard methods and create the actions with them on your
media type. If done right, there's less coupling, and changes can be dealt
with more gracefully. A client is supposed to enter a REST service with zero
knowledge of the API, except for the entry point and the media type. In SOAP,
the client needs previous knowledge on everything it will be using, or it
won't even begin the interaction. Additionally, a REST client can be extended
by code-on-demand supplied by the server itself, the classical example being
JavaScript code used to drive the interaction with another service on the
client-side.</p>
<p>I think these are the crucial points to understand what REST is about, and how
it differs from SOAP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>REST is protocol independent. It's not coupled to HTTP. Pretty much like you can follow an ftp link on a website, a REST application can use any protocol for which there is a standardized URI scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST is not a mapping of CRUD to HTTP methods. Read this answer for a detailed explanation on that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST is as standardized as the parts you're using. Security and authentication in HTTP are standardized, so that's what you use when doing REST over HTTP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST is not REST without hypermedia and HATEOAS. This means that a client only knows the entry point URI and the resources are supposed to return links the client should follow. Those fancy documentation generators that give URI patterns for everything you can do in a REST API miss the point completely. They are not only documenting something that's supposed to be following the standard, but when you do that, you're coupling the client to one particular moment in the evolution of the API, and any changes on the API have to be documented and applied, or it will break.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST is the architectural style of the web itself. When you enter Stack Overflow, you know what a User, a Question and an Answer are, you know the media types, and the website provides you with the links to them. A REST API has to do the same. If we designed the web the way people think REST should be done, instead of having a home page with links to Questions and Answers, we'd have a static documentation explaining that in order to view a question, you have to take the URI <code>stackoverflow.com/questions/&lt;id&gt;</code>, replace id with the Question.id and paste that on your browser. That's nonsense, but that's what many people think REST is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point can't be emphasized enough. If your clients are building URIs
from templates in documentation and not getting links in the resource
representations, that's not REST. Roy Fielding, the author of REST, made it
clear on this blog post: REST APIs must be hypertext-driven.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, you'll realize that while REST might not be restricted
to XML, to do it correctly with any other format you'll have to design and
standardize some format for your links. Hyperlinks are standard in XML, but
not in JSON. There are draft standards for JSON, like HAL.</p>
<p>Finally, REST isn't for everyone, and a proof of that is how most people solve
their problems very well with the HTTP APIs they mistakenly called REST and
never venture beyond that. REST is hard to do sometimes, especially in the
beginning, but it pays over time with easier evolution on the server side, and
client's resilience to changes. If you need something done quickly and easily,
don't bother about getting REST right. It's probably not what you're looking
for. If you need something that will have to stay online for years or even
decades, then REST is for you.</p>

<p><code>REST</code> vs <code>SOAP</code> is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the right question to ask.</p>
<p><code>REST</code>, unlike <code>SOAP</code> is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a protocol.</p>
<p><code>REST</code> is an <em>architectural style</em> and a <em>design</em> for network-based software
architectures.</p>
<p><code>REST</code> concepts are referred to as resources. A representation of a resource
must be stateless. It is represented via some media type. Some examples of
media types include <code>XML</code>, <code>JSON</code>, and <code>RDF</code>. Resources are manipulated by
components. Components request and manipulate resources via a standard uniform
interface. In the case of HTTP, this interface consists of standard HTTP ops
e.g. <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>.</p>
<p>@Abdulaziz's question does illuminate the fact that <code>REST</code> and <code>HTTP</code> are
often used in tandem. This is primarily due to the simplicity of HTTP and its
very natural mapping to RESTful principles.</p>
<h4>Fundamental REST Principles</h4>
<p><strong>Client-Server Communication</strong></p>
<p>Client-server architectures have a very distinct separation of concerns. All
applications built in the RESTful style must also be client-server in
principle.</p>
<p><strong>Stateless</strong></p>
<p>Each client request to the server requires that its state be fully
represented. The server must be able to completely understand the client
request without using any server context or server session state. It follows
that all state must be kept on the client.</p>
<p><strong>Cacheable</strong></p>
<p>Cache constraints may be used, thus enabling response data to be marked as
cacheable or not-cacheable. Any data marked as cacheable may be reused as the
response to the same subsequent request.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Interface</strong></p>
<p>All components must interact through a single uniform interface. Because all
component interaction occurs via this interface, interaction with different
services is very simple. The interface is the same! This also means that
implementation changes can be made in isolation. Such changes, will not affect
fundamental component interaction because the uniform interface is always
unchanged. One disadvantage is that you are stuck with the interface. If an
optimization could be provided to a specific service by changing the
interface, you are out of luck as REST prohibits this. On the bright side,
however, REST is optimized for the web, hence incredible popularity of REST
over HTTP!</p>
<p>The above concepts represent defining characteristics of REST and
differentiate the REST architecture from other architectures like web
services. It is useful to note that a REST service is a web service, but a web
service is not necessarily a REST service.</p>

and the above stated bullets.</p>
