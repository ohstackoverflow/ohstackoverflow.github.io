    <p>I need to hide all <em>permission denied</em> messages from:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">find . &gt; files_and_folders
</pre></div>

<p>I am experimenting when such message arises. I need to gather all folders and
files, to which it does not arise.</p>
<p>Is it possible to direct the permission levels to the <code>files_and_folders</code>
file?</p>
<p>How can I hide the errors at the same time?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>This answer probably goes deeper than the use case warrants, and <strong><code>find 2&gt;/dev/null</code> may be good enough in many situations</strong>. It may still be of interest for a cross-platform perspective and for its discussion of some advanced shell techniques in the interest of finding a solution that is as robust as possible, even though the cases guarded against may be largely hypothetical.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If your <strong>shell is<code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code></strong>, there's <strong>a solution that is robust while
being reasonably simple</strong> , using <strong>only POSIX-compliant<code>find</code> features</strong>;
while <code>bash</code> itself is not part of POSIX, most modern Unix platforms come with
it, making this solution widely portable:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">find . &gt; files_and_folders 2&gt; &gt;(grep -v 'Permission denied' &gt;&amp;2)
</pre></div>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If your system is configured to show <em>localized</em> error messages, prefix the <code>find</code> calls below with <code>LC_ALL=C</code></strong> (<code>LC_ALL=C find ...</code>) to ensure that <em>English</em> messages are reported, so that <code>grep -v 'Permission denied'</code> works as intended. Invariably, however, any error messages that <em>do</em> get displayed will then be in English as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&gt;(...)</code> is a (rarely used) <em>output</em> process substitution that allows redirecting output (in this case, <em>stderr</em> output (<code>2&gt;</code>) to the stdin of the command inside <code>&gt;(...)</code>.<br>
In addition to <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code>, <code>ksh</code> supports them as well <em>in principle</em> ,
but trying to combine them with redirection from <em>stderr</em> , as is done here
(<code>2&gt; &gt;(...)</code>), appears to be silently ignored (in <code>ksh 93u+</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>grep -v 'Permission denied'</code> filters <em>out</em> (<code>-v</code>) all lines (from the <code>find</code> command's stderr stream) that contain the phrase <code>Permission denied</code> and outputs the remaining lines to stderr (<code>&gt;&amp;2</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: There's a small chance that some of <code>grep</code>'s output may arrive <em>after</em> <code>find</code> completes, because the overall command doesn't wait for the command inside <code>&gt;(...)</code> to finish. In <code>bash</code>, you can prevent this by appending <code>| cat</code> to the command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>robust</strong> : <code>grep</code> is only applied to <em>error messages</em> (and not to a combination of file paths and error messages, potentially leading to false positives), and error messages other than permission-denied ones are passed through, to stderr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>side-effect free</strong> : <code>find</code>'s exit code is preserved: the inability to access at least one of the filesystem items encountered results in exit code <code>1</code> (although that won't tell you whether errors <em>other</em> than permission-denied ones occurred (too)).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>POSIX-compliant solutions:</h4>
<p>Fully POSIX-compliant solutions either have limitations or require additional
work.</p>
<p><strong>If<code>find</code>'s output is to be captured in a <em>file</em> anyway</strong> (or suppressed
altogether), then the pipeline-based solution from Jonathan Leffler's answer
is simple, robust, and POSIX-compliant:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">find . 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;files_and_folders | grep -v 'Permission denied' &gt;&amp;2
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the order of the redirections matters: <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> must come <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>Capturing stdout output in a file up front allows <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> to send <em>only</em> error
messages through the pipeline, which <code>grep</code> can then unambiguously operate on.</p>
<p>The <strong>only downside is that the <em>overall exit code</em> will be the <code>grep</code>
command's</strong>, not <code>find</code>'s, which in this case means: if there are <em>no</em> errors
at all or <em>only</em> permission-denied errors, the exit code will be <code>1</code>
(signaling <em>failure</em> ), otherwise (errors other than permission-denied ones)
<code>0</code> - which is the opposite of the intent.<br><strong>That said,<code>find</code>'s exit code is rarely used anyway</strong>, as it often conveys
little information beyond <em>fundamental</em> failure such as passing a non-existent
path.<br>
However, the specific case of even only <em>some</em> of the input paths being
inaccessible due to lack of permissions <em>is</em> reflected in <code>find</code>'s exit code
(in both GNU and BSD <code>find</code>): if a permissions-denied error occurs for <em>any</em>
of the files processed, the exit code is set to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The following variation addresses that:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">find . 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;files_and_folders | { grep -v 'Permission denied' &gt;&amp;2; [ $? -eq 1 ]; }
</pre></div>

<p>Now, the exit code indicates whether any errors <em>other than</em> <code>Permission
denied</code> occurred: <code>1</code> if so, <code>0</code> otherwise.<br>
In other words: the exit code now reflects the true intent of the command:
success (<code>0</code>) is reported, if no errors at all or <em>only</em> permission-denied
errors occurred.<br>
This is arguably even better than just passing <code>find</code>'s exit code through, as
in the solution at the top.</p>
<hr>
<p>gniourf_gniourf in the comments proposes a (still POSIX-compliant)
<strong>generalization of this solution using sophisticated redirections</strong> , which
<strong>works even with the default behavior of printing the file paths to
<em>stdout</em></strong> :</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">{ find . 3&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;3 | grep -v 'Permission denied' &gt;&amp;3; } 3&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre></div>

<p>In short: Custom file descriptor <code>3</code> is used to temporarily swap stdout (<code>1</code>)
and stderr (<code>2</code>), so that error messages <em>alone</em> can be piped to <code>grep</code> via
stdout.</p>
<p>Without these redirections, both data (file paths) <em>and</em> error messages would
be piped to <code>grep</code> via stdout, and <code>grep</code> would then not be able to
distinguish between <em>error message</em> <code>Permission denied</code> and a (hypothetical)
<em>file whose name happens to contain</em> the phrase <code>Permission denied</code>.</p>
<p>As in the first solution, however, the the exit code reported will be
<code>grep</code>'s, not <code>find</code>'s, but the same fix as above can be applied.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Notes on the existing answers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are several points to note about Michael Brux's answer, <code>find . ! -readable -prune -o -print</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It requires <em>GNU</em> <code>find</code>; notably, it won't work on macOS. Of course, if you only ever need the command to work with GNU <code>find</code>, this won't be a problem for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some <code>Permission denied</code> errors may <em>still</em> surface: <code>find ! -readable -prune</code> reports such errors for the <em>child</em> items of directories for which the current user does have <code>r</code> permission, but lacks <code>x</code> (executable) permission. The reason is that because the directory itself <em>is</em> readable, <code>-prune</code> is not executed, and the attempt to descend <em>into</em> that directory then triggers the error messages. That said, the <em>typical</em> case is for the <code>r</code> permission to be missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: The following point is a matter of philosophy and/or specific use case, and you may decide it is not relevant to you and that the command fits your needs well, especially if simply <em>printing</em> the paths is all you do:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If</em> you conceptualize the filtering of the permission-denied error messages a <em>separate</em> task that you want to be able to apply to <em>any</em> <code>find</code> command, then the opposite approach of proactively <em>preventing</em> permission-denied errors requires introducing "noise" into the <code>find</code> command, which also introduces complexity and logical <em>pitfalls</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>For instance, the most up-voted comment on Michael's answer (as of this writing) attempts to show how to <em>extend</em> the command by including a <code>-name</code> filter, as follows:<br><code>find . ! -readable -prune -o -name '*.txt'</code><br>
This, however, does <em>not</em> work as intended, because the trailing <code>-print</code>
action is <em>required</em> (an explanation can be found in this answer). Such
subtleties can introduce bugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first solution in Jonathan Leffler's answer, <code>find . 2&gt;/dev/null &gt; files_and_folders</code>, as he himself states, <strong>blindly silences <em>all</em> error messages</strong> (and the workaround is cumbersome and not fully robust, as he also explains). <strong>Pragmatically speaking</strong> , however, it is the <strong>simplest solution</strong> , as you may be content to assume that any and all errors would be permission-related.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mist's answer, <code>sudo find . &gt; files_and_folders</code>, <strong>is concise and pragmatic, but ill-advised for anything other than merely <em>printing</em> filenames</strong>, for security reasons: because you're running as the <em>root</em> user, "you risk having your whole system being messed up by a bug in find or a malicious version, or an incorrect invocation which writes something unexpectedly, which could not happen if you ran this with normal privileges" (from a comment on mist's answer by tripleee).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2nd solution in viraptor's answer, <code>find . 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v 'Permission denied' &gt; some_file</code> runs the risk of false positives (due to sending a mix of stdout and stderr through the pipeline), and, potentially, instead of reporting <em>non</em> -permission-denied errors via stderr, captures them alongside the output paths in the output file.</p>
