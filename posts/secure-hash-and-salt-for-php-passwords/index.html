    <p>It is currently said that MD5 is partially unsafe. Taking this into
consideration, I'd like to know which mechanism to use for password
protection.</p>
<p>This question, Is “double hashing” a password less secure than just hashing it
once? suggests that hashing multiple times may be a good idea, whereas How to
implement password protection for individual files? suggests using salt.</p>
<p>I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a
password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good
balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a
constant number of characters.</p>
<ol>
<li>The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP</li>
<li>It must be safe</li>
<li>It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one
using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer?</p>
<p>In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use
and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password
protection mechanism.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> : This answer was written in 2008.</p>
<p>Since then, PHP has given us <code>password_hash</code> and <code>password_verify</code> and,
since their introduction, they are the recommended password hashing &amp;
checking method.</p>
<p>The theory of the answer is still a good read though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<h4>Don'ts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't limit what characters users can enter for passwords. Only idiots do this.</li>
<li>Don't limit the length of a password. If your users want a sentence with supercalifragilisticexpialidocious in it, don't prevent them from using it.</li>
<li>Don't strip or escape HTML and special characters in the password.</li>
<li>Never store your user's password in plain-text.</li>
<li>Never email a password to your user <em>except when they have lost theirs, and you sent a temporary one.</em>
</li>
<li>Never, ever log passwords in any manner.</li>
<li>Never hash passwords with SHA1 or MD5 or even SHA256! Modern crackers can exceed 60 and 180 billion hashes/second (respectively).</li>
<li>Don't mix bcrypt and with the <em>raw</em> output of hash(), either use hex output or base64_encode it. (This applies to any input that may have a rogue <code>\0</code> in it, which can seriously weaken security.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dos</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use scrypt when you can; bcrypt if you cannot.</li>
<li>Use PBKDF2 if you cannot use either bcrypt or scrypt, with SHA2 hashes.</li>
<li>Reset everyone's passwords when the database is compromised.</li>
<li>Implement a reasonable 8-10 character minimum length, plus require at least 1 upper case letter, 1 lower case letter, a number, and a symbol. This will improve the entropy of the password, in turn making it harder to crack. (See the "What makes a good password?" section for some debate.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why hash passwords anyway?</h3>
<p>The objective behind hashing passwords is simple: preventing malicious access
to user accounts by compromising the database. So the goal of password hashing
is to deter a hacker or cracker by costing them too much time or money to
calculate the plain-text passwords. And time/cost are the best deterrents in
your arsenal.</p>
<p>Another reason that you want a good, robust hash on a user accounts is to give
you enough time to change all the passwords in the system. If your database is
compromised you will need enough time to at <em>least</em> lock the system down, if
not change every password in the database.</p>
<p>Jeremiah Grossman, CTO of Whitehat Security, stated on White Hat Security blog
after a recent password recovery that required brute-force breaking of his
password protection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, in living out this nightmare, I learned A LOT I didn’t know
about password cracking, storage, and complexity. <em>I’ve come to appreciate
why password storage is ever so much more important than password
complexity. If you don’t know how your password is stored, then all you
really can depend upon is complexity.</em> This might be common knowledge to
password and crypto pros, but for the average InfoSec or Web Security
expert, I highly doubt it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<h3>What makes a <em>good</em> password anyway?</h3>
<p>Entropy. (Not that I fully subscribe to Randall's viewpoint.)</p>
<p>In short, entropy is how much variation is within the password. When a
password is only lowercase roman letters, that's only 26 characters. That
isn't much variation. Alpha-numeric passwords are better, with 36 characters.
But allowing upper and lower case, with symbols, is roughly 96 characters.
That's a lot better than just letters. One problem is, to make our passwords
memorable we insert patterns—which reduces entropy. Oops!</p>
<p>Password entropy is approximated easily. Using the full range of ascii
characters (roughly 96 typeable characters) yields an entropy of 6.6 per
character, which at 8 characters for a password is still too low (52.679 bits
of entropy) for future security. But the good news is: longer passwords, and
passwords with unicode characters, really increase the entropy of a password
and make it harder to crack.</p>
<p>There's a longer discussion of password entropy on the Crypto StackExchange
site. A good Google search will also turn up a lot of results.</p>
<p>In the comments I talked with @popnoodles, who pointed out that <em>enforcing</em> a
password policy of X length with X many letters, numbers, symbols, etc, can
actually reduce entropy by making the password scheme more predictable. I do
agree. Randomess, as truly random as possible, is always the safest but least
memorable solution.</p>
<p>So far as I've been able to tell, making the world's best password is a
Catch-22. Either its not memorable, too predictable, too short, too many
unicode characters (hard to type on a Windows/Mobile device), too long, etc.
No password is truly good enough for our purposes, so we must protect them as
though they were in Fort Knox.</p>
<h3>Best practices</h3>
<p>Bcrypt and scrypt are the current best practices. Scrypt will be better than
bcrypt in time, but it hasn't seen adoption as a standard by Linux/Unix or by
webservers, and hasn't had in-depth reviews of its algorithm posted yet. But
still, the future of the algorithm does look promising. If you are working
with Ruby there is an scrypt gem that will help you out, and Node.js now has
its own scrypt package. You can use Scrypt in PHP either via the Scrypt
extension or the Libsodium extension (both are available in PECL).</p>
<p>I highly suggest reading the documentation for the crypt function if you want
to understand how to use bcrypt, or finding yourself a good wrapper or use
something like PHPASS for a more legacy implementation. I recommend a minimum
of 12 rounds of bcrypt, if not 15 to 18.</p>
<p>I changed my mind about using bcrypt when I learned that bcrypt only uses
blowfish's key schedule, with a variable cost mechanism. The latter lets you
increase the cost to brute-force a password by increasing blowfish's already
expensive key schedule.</p>
<h3>Average practices</h3>
<p>I almost can't imagine this situation anymore. PHPASS supports PHP 3.0.18
through 5.3, so it is usable on almost every installation imaginable—and
should be used if you don't <em>know for certain</em> that your environment supports
bcrypt.</p>
<p>But suppose that you cannot use bcrypt or PHPASS at all. What then?</p>
<p>Try an implementation of PDKBF2 with the maximum number of rounds that your
environment/application/user-perception can tolerate. The lowest number I'd
recommend is 2500 rounds. Also, make sure to use hash_hmac() if it is
available to make the operation harder to reproduce.</p>
<h3>Future Practices</h3>
<p>Coming in PHP 5.5 is a full password protection library that abstracts away
any pains of working with bcrypt. While most of us are stuck with PHP 5.2 and
5.3 in most common environments, especially shared hosts, @ircmaxell has built
a compatibility layer for the coming API that is backward compatible to PHP
5.3.7.</p>
<h3>Cryptography Recap &amp; Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The computational power required to actually <em>crack</em> a hashed password doesn't
exist. The only way for computers to "crack" a password is to recreate it and
simulate the hashing algorithm used to secure it. The speed of the hash is
linearly related to its ability to be brute-forced. Worse still, most hash
algorithms can be easily parallelized to perform even faster. This is why
costly schemes like bcrypt and scrypt are so important.</p>
<p>You cannot possibly foresee all threats or avenues of attack, and so you must
make your best effort to protect your users <strong>up front</strong>. If you do not, then
you might even miss the fact that you were attacked until it's too late...
<em>and you're liable</em>. To avoid that situation, act paranoid to begin with.
Attack your own software (internally) and attempt to steal user credentials,
or modify other user's accounts or access their data. If you don't test the
security of your system, then you cannot blame anyone but yourself.</p>
<p>Lastly: I am not a cryptographer. Whatever I've said is my opinion, but I
happen to think it's based on good ol' common sense ... and lots of reading.
Remember, be as paranoid as possible, make things as hard to intrude as
possible, and then, if you are still worried, contact a white-hat hacker or
cryptographer to see what they say about your code/system.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>A much shorter and safer answer - <strong>don't write your own password mechanism at
all</strong> , use a tried and tested mechanism.</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.5 or higher: password_hash() is good quality and part of PHP core.</li>
<li>PHP 4.x (obsolete): OpenWall's phpass library is much better than most custom code - used in WordPress, Drupal, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most programmers just don't have the expertise to write crypto related code
safely without introducing vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Quick self-test:</strong> what is password stretching and how many iterations
should you use? If you don't know the answer, you should use
<code>password_hash()</code>, as password stretching is now a critical feature of
password mechanisms due to much faster CPUs and the use of GPUs and FPGAs to
crack passwords at rates of billions of guesses per second (with GPUs).</p>
<p>As of 2012, you could crack all 8-character Windows passwords in 6 hours using
25 GPUs installed in 5 desktop PCs. This is brute-forcing i.e. enumerating and
checking <em>every 8-character Windows password</em> , including special characters,
and is not a dictionary attack. With modern GPUs, you can of course crack more
passwords or use fewer GPUs - or rent the GPUs in the cloud for a few hours at
reasonable cost.</p>
<p>There are also many rainbow table attacks on Windows passwords that run on
ordinary CPUs and are very fast.</p>
<p>All this is because Windows <em>still</em> doesn't salt or stretch its passwords,
even in Windows 10. This is still true in 2021. Don't make the same mistake as
Microsoft did!</p>
