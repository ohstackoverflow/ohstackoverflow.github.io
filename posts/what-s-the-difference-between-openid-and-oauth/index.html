<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>OpenID is about authentication (ie. proving who you are), OAuth is about
authorisation (ie. to grant access to functionality/data/etc.. without having
to deal with the original authentication).</p>
<p>OAuth could be used in external partner sites to allow access to protected
data without them having to re-authenticate a user.</p>
<p>The blog post "OpenID versus OAuth from the user’s perspective" has a simple
comparison of the two from the user's perspective and "OAuth-OpenID: You’re
Barking Up the Wrong Tree if you Think They’re the Same Thing" has more
information about it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There are three ways to compare OAuth and OpenID:</p>
<p><strong>1. Purposes</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenID was created for federated authentication, that is, letting a third-
party authenticate your users for you, by using accounts they already have</strong>.
The term federated is critical here because the whole point of OpenID is that
any provider can be used (with the exception of white-lists). You don't need
to pre-choose or negotiate a deal with the providers to allow users to use any
other account they have.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth was created to remove the need for users to share their passwords with
third-party applications</strong>. It actually started as a way to solve an OpenID
problem: if you support OpenID on your site, you can't use HTTP Basic
credentials (username and password) to provide an API because the users don't
have a password on your site.</p>
<p>The problem is with this separation of OpenID for authentication and OAuth for
authorization is that both protocols can accomplish many of the same things.
They each provide a different set of features which are desired by different
implementations but essentially, they are pretty interchangeable. At their
core, both protocols are an assertion verification method (OpenID is limited
to the 'this is who I am' assertion, while OAuth provides an 'access token'
that can be exchanged for any supported assertion via an API).</p>
<p><strong>2. Features</strong></p>
<p>Both protocols provide a way for a site to redirect a user somewhere else and
come back with a verifiable assertion. <em><strong>OpenID provides an identity
assertion while OAuth is more generic in the form of an access token which can
then be used to "ask the OAuth provider questions"</strong></em>. However, they each
support different features:</p>
<p><strong>OpenID</strong> - the most important feature of OpenID is its discovery process.
OpenID does not require hard coding each the providers you want to use ahead
of time. Using discovery, the user can choose any third-party provider they
want to authenticate. This discovery feature has also caused most of OpenID's
problems because the way it is implemented is by using HTTP URIs as
identifiers which most web users just don't get. Other features OpenID has is
its support for ad-hoc client registration using a DH exchange, immediate mode
for optimized end-user experience, and a way to verify assertions without
making another round-trip to the provider.</p>
<p><strong>OAuth</strong> - the most important feature of OAuth is the access token which
provides a long lasting method of making additional requests. Unlike OpenID,
OAuth does not end with authentication but provides an access token to gain
access to additional resources provided by the same third-party service.
However, since OAuth does not support discovery, it requires pre-selecting and
hard-coding the providers you decide to use. A user visiting your site cannot
use any identifier, only those pre-selected by you. Also, OAuth does not have
a concept of identity so using it for login means either adding a custom
parameter (as done by Twitter) or making another API call to get the currently
"logged in" user.</p>
<p><strong>3. Technical Implementations</strong></p>
<p>The two protocols share a common architecture in using redirection to obtain
user authorization. In OAuth the user authorizes access to their protected
resources and in OpenID, to their identity. But that's all they share.</p>
<p>Each protocol has a different way of calculating a signature used to verify
the authenticity of the request or response, and each has different
registration requirements.</p>
