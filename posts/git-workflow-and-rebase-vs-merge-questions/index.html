    <p>I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other
developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a
lot of baggage to the relationship.</p>
<p>I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I
just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge,
everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to
me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.</p>
<p>My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly,
and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For
example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</pre></div>

<p>Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch,
and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch
always stays local.</p>
<p>Here is the workflow that I started with</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch
</pre></div>

<p>There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of
rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the
remote repository.</p>
<p>My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm
working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if
something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I
hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.</p>
<p>My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be
standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that
what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be
unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and
they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to
merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts
with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to
me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a
forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts
resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.</p>
<p>What is the "correct" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to
make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2011-04-15</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two
years experience since I first asked.</p>
<p>It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In
other words, this is what we do and it works:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
</pre></div>

<p>In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do <em>squash merges</em>
instead of raw merges. ( <strong>Note: This is controversial, see below.</strong> ) This
allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master.
Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our
commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is
what we do:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m "added my_new_feature"
git branch -D my_new_feature
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Squash Merge Controversy</strong> - As several commenters have pointed out, the
squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name
implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small
features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For
larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual
commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.</p>
<p><strong>Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests</strong> - In case you're wondering
how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above
steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually
merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash
merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the
accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know).
Specifically, it works like this:</p>

just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>"Conflicts" mean "parallel evolutions of a same content". So if it goes "all
to hell" during a merge, it means you have massive evolutions on the same set
of files.</p>
<p>The reason why a rebase is then better than a merge is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you rewrite your local commit history with the one of the master (and then reapply your work, resolving any conflict then)</li>
<li>the final merge will certainly be a "fast forward" one, because it will have all the commit history of the master, plus only your changes to reapply.</li>
</ul>
<p>I confirm that the correct workflow in that case (evolutions on common set of
files) is <strong>rebase first, then merge</strong>.</p>
<p>However, that means that, if you push your local branch (for backup reason),
that branch should not be pulled (or at least used) by anyone else (since the
commit history will be rewritten by the successive rebase).</p>
