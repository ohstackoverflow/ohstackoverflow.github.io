<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Overriding depends on having an instance of a class. The point of polymorphism
is that you can subclass a class and the objects implementing those subclasses
will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the superclass
(and overridden in the subclasses). A static method is not associated with any
instance of a class so the concept is not applicable.</p>
<p>There were two considerations driving Java's design that impacted this. One
was a concern with performance: there had been a lot of criticism of Smalltalk
about it being too slow (garbage collection and polymorphic calls being part
of that) and Java's creators were determined to avoid that. Another was the
decision that the target audience for Java was C++ developers. Making static
methods work the way they do had the benefit of familiarity for C++
programmers and was also very fast, because there's no need to wait until
runtime to figure out which method to call.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Personally I think this is a flaw in the design of Java. Yes, yes, I
understand that non-static methods are attached to an instance while static
methods are attached to a class, etc etc. Still, consider the following code:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">RegularEmployee</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">BigDecimal</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">getBonusMultiplier</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">BigDecimal</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">calculateBonus</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">salary</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">multiply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">getBonusMultiplier</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">/*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">presumably</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">lots</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">other</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*/</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">SpecialEmployee</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">extends</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">RegularEmployee</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">BigDecimal</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">getBonusMultiplier</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">BigDecimal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">".03"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This code will not work as you might expect. Namely, SpecialEmployee's get a
2% bonus just like regular employees. But if you remove the "static"s, then
SpecialEmployee's get a 3% bonus.</p>
<p>(Admittedly, this example is poor coding style in that in real life you would
likely want the bonus multiplier to be in a database somewhere rather than
hard-coded. But that's just because I didn't want to bog down the example with
a lot of code irrelevant to the point.)</p>
<p>It seems quite plausible to me that you might want to make getBonusMultiplier
static. Perhaps you want to be able to display the bonus multiplier for all
the categories of employees, without needing to have an instance of an
employee in each category. What would be the point of searching for such
example instances? What if we are creating a new category of employee and
don't have any employees assigned to it yet? This is quite logically a static
function.</p>
<p>But it doesn't work.</p>
<p>And yes, yes, I can think of any number of ways to rewrite the above code to
make it work. My point is not that it creates an unsolvable problem, but that
it creates a trap for the unwary programmer, because the language does not
behave as I think a reasonable person would expect.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I tried to write a compiler for an OOP language, I would quickly
see why implementing it so that static functions can be overriden would be
difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>Or perhaps there is some good reason why Java behaves this way. Can anyone
point out an advantage to this behavior, some category of problem that is made
easier by this? I mean, don't just point me to the Java language spec and say
"see, this is documented how it behaves". I know that. But is there a good
reason why it SHOULD behave this way? (Besides the obvious "making it work
right was too hard"...)</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>@VicKirk: If you mean that this is "bad design" because it doesn't fit how
Java handles statics, my reply is, "Well, duh, of course." As I said in my
original post, it doesn't work. But if you mean that it is bad design in the
sense that there would be something fundamentally wrong with a language where
this worked, i.e. where statics could be overridden just like virtual
functions, that this would somehow introduce an ambiguity or it would be
impossible to implement efficiently or some such, I reply, "Why? What's wrong
with the concept?"</p>
<p>I think the example I give is a very natural thing to want to do. I have a
class that has a function that does not depend on any instance data, and which
I might very reasonably want to call independent of an instance, as well as
wanting to call from within an instance method. Why should this not work? I've
run into this situation a fair number of times over the years. In practice I
get around it by making the function virtual, and then creating a static
method whose only purpose in life is to be a static method that passes the
call on to the virtual method with a dummy instance. That seems like a very
roundabout way to get there.</p>
