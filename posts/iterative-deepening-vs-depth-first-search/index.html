    <p>I keep reading about <em>iterative deepening</em> , but I don't understand how it
differs from <em>depth-first search</em>.</p>
<p>I understood that depth-first search keeps going deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>In iterative deepening you establish a value of a level, if there is no
solution at that level, you increment that value, and start again from scratch
(the root).</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn't this be the same thing as depth-first search?</strong></p>
<p>I mean you would keep incrementing and incrementing, going deeper until you
find a solution. I see this as the same thing! I would be going down the same
branch, because if I start again from scratch I would go down the same branch
as before.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In a depth-first search, you begin at some node in the graph and continuously
explore deeper and deeper into the graph while you can find new nodes that you
haven't yet reached (or until you find the solution). Any time the DFS runs
out of moves, it backtracks to the latest point where it could make a
different choice, then explores out from there. This can be a serious problem
if your graph is extremely large and there's only one solution, since you
might end up exploring the entire graph along one DFS path only to find the
solution after looking at each node. Worse, if the graph is infinite (perhaps
your graph consists of all the numbers, for example), the search might not
terminate. Moreover, once you find the node you're looking for, you might not
have the optimal path to it (you could have looped all over the graph looking
for the solution even though it was right next to the start node!)</p>
<p>One potential fix to this problem would be to limit the depth of any one path
taken by the DFS. For example, we might do a DFS search, but stop the search
if we ever take a path of length greater than 5. This ensures that we never
explore any node that's of distance greater than five from the start node,
meaning that we never explore out infinitely or (unless the graph is extremely
dense) we don't search the entire graph. However, this does mean that we might
not find the node we're looking for, since we don't necessarily explore the
entire graph.</p>
<p>The idea behind iterative deepening is to use this second approach but to keep
increasing the depth at each level. In other words, we might try exploring
using all paths of length one, then all paths of length two, then length
three, etc. until we end up finding the node in question. This means that we
never end up exploring along infinite dead-end paths, since the length of each
path is capped by some length at each step. It also means that we find the
shortest possible path to the destination node, since if we didn't find the
node at depth d but did find it at depth d + 1, there can't be a path of
length d (or we would have taken it), so the path of length d + 1 is indeed
optimal.</p>
<p>The reason that this is different from a DFS is that it never runs into the
case where it takes an extremely long and circuitous path around the graph
without ever terminating. The lengths of the paths are always capped, so we
never end up exploring unnecessary branches.</p>
<p>The reason that this is different from BFS is that in a BFS, you have to hold
all of the fringe nodes in memory at once. This takes memory O(bd), where b is
the branching factor. Compare this to the O(d) memory usage from iterative
deepening (to hold the state for each of the d nodes in the current path). Of
course, BFS never explores the same path multiple times, while iterative
deepening may explore any path several times as it increases the depth limit.
However, asymptotically the two have the same runtime. BFS terminates in O(bd)
steps after considering all O(bd) nodes at distance d. Iterative deepening
uses O(bd) time per level, which sums up to O(bd) overall, but with a higher
constant factor.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>DFS is not guaranteed to find an optimal path; iterative deepening is.</li>
<li>DFS may explore the entire graph before finding the target node; iterative deepening only does this if the distance between the start and end node is the maximum in the graph.</li>
<li>BFS and iterative deepening both run in time O(bd), but iterative deepening likely has a higher constant factor.</li>
<li>BFS uses O(bd) memory, while iterative deepening uses only O(d).</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There is a decent page on wikipedia about this.</p>
<p>The basic idea I think you missed is that iterative deepening is primarily a
<em>heuristic</em>. When a solution is likely to be found close to the root iterative
deepening is will find it relatively fast while straightfoward depth-first-
search could make a "wrong" decision and spend a lot of time on a fruitless
deep branch.</p>
<p>(This is particularly important when the search tree can be infinite. <strong>In
this case they are even less equivalent</strong> since DFS can get stuck forever
while BFS or iterative deepening are sure to find the answer one day if it
exists)</p>
