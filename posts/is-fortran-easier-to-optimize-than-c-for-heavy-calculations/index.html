    <p>From time to time I read that Fortran is or can be faster then C for heavy
calculations. Is that really true? I must admit that I hardly know Fortran,
but the Fortran code I have seen so far did not show that the language has
features that C doesn't have.</p>
<p>If it is true, please tell me why. Please don't tell me what languages or libs
are good for number crunching, I don't intend to write an app or lib to do
that, I'm just curious.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The languages have similar feature-sets. The performance difference comes from
the fact that Fortran says aliasing is not allowed, unless an EQUIVALENCE
statement is used. Any code that has aliasing is not valid Fortran, but it is
up to the programmer and not the compiler to detect these errors. Thus Fortran
compilers ignore possible aliasing of memory pointers and allow them to
generate more efficient code. Take a look at this little example in C:</p>

<p>This function would run slower than the Fortran counterpart after
optimization. Why so? If you write values into the output array, you may
change the values of matrix. After all, the pointers could overlap and point
to the same chunk of memory (including the <code>int</code> pointer!). The C compiler is
forced to reload the four matrix values from memory for all computations.</p>
<p>In Fortran the compiler can load the matrix values once and store them in
registers. It can do so because the Fortran compiler assumes pointers/arrays
do not overlap in memory.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <code>restrict</code> keyword and strict-aliasing have been introduced
to the C99 standard to address this problem. It's well supported in most C++
compilers these days as well. The keyword allows you to give the compiler a
hint that the programmer promises that a pointer does not alias with any other
pointer. The strict-aliasing means that the programmer promises that pointers
of different type will never overlap, for example a <code>double*</code> will not overlap
with an <code>int*</code> (with the specific exception that <code>char*</code> and <code>void*</code> can
overlap with anything).</p>
<p>If you use them you will get the same speed from C and Fortran. However, the
ability to use the <code>restrict</code> keyword only with performance critical functions
means that C (and C++) programs are much safer and easier to write. For
example, consider the invalid Fortran code: <code>CALL TRANSFORM(A(1, 30), A(2,
31), A(3, 32), 30)</code>, which most Fortran compilers will happily compile without
any warning but introduces a bug that only shows up on some compilers, on some
hardware and with some optimization options.</p>

<p>When I started programming professionally the speed dominance of Fortran was
just being challenged. I remember reading about it in Dr. Dobbs and telling
the older programmers about the article--they laughed.</p>
<p>So I have two views about this, theoretical and practical. <em>In theory</em> Fortran
today has no intrinsic advantage to C/C++ or even any language that allows
assembly code. <em>In practice</em> Fortran today still enjoys the benefits of legacy
of a history and culture built around optimization of numerical code.</p>
<p>Up until and including Fortran 77, language design considerations had
optimization as a main focus. Due to the state of compiler theory and
technology, this often meant <em>restricting</em> features and capability in order to
give the compiler the best shot at optimizing the code. A good analogy is to
think of Fortran 77 as a professional race car that sacrifices features for
speed. These days compilers have gotten better across all languages and
features for programmer productivity are more valued. However, there are still
places where the people are mainly concerned with speed in scientific
computing; these people most likely have inherited code, training and culture
from people who themselves were Fortran programmers.</p>
<p>When one starts talking about optimization of code there are many issues and
the best way to get a feel for this is to lurk where people are whose job it
is to have fast numerical code. But keep in mind that such critically
sensitive code is usually a small fraction of the overall lines of code and
very specialized: A lot of Fortran code is just as "inefficient" as a lot of
other code in other languages and optimization should not even be a primary
concern of such code.</p>
<p>A wonderful place to start in learning about the history and culture of
Fortran is wikipedia. The Fortran Wikipedia entry is superb and I very much
appreciate those who have taken the time and effort to make it of value for
the Fortran community.</p>
<p>(A shortened version of this answer would have been a comment in the excellent
thread started by <strong>Nils</strong> but I don't have the karma to do that. Actually, I
probably wouldn't have written anything at all but for that this thread has
actual information content and sharing as opposed to flame wars and language
bigotry, which is my main experience with this subject. I was overwhelmed and
had to share the love.)</p>
