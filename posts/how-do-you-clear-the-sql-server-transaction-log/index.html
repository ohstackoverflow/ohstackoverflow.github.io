    <p>I'm not a SQL expert, and I'm reminded of the fact every time I need to do
something beyond the basics. I have a test database that is not large in size,
but the transaction log definitely is. How do I clear out the transaction log?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Making a log file smaller should really be reserved for scenarios where it
encountered unexpected growth which you do not expect to happen again. If the
log file will grow to the same size again, not very much is accomplished by
shrinking it temporarily. Now, depending on the recovery goals of your
database, these are the actions you should take.</p>
<h2>First, take a full backup</h2>
<p>Never make any changes to your database without ensuring you can restore it
should something go wrong.</p>
<h2>If you care about point-in-time recovery</h2>
<p>(And by point-in-time recovery, I mean you care about being able to restore to
anything other than a full or differential backup.)</p>
<p>Presumably your database is in <code>FULL</code> recovery mode. If not, then make sure it
is:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ALTER DATABASE testdb SET RECOVERY FULL;
</pre></div>

<p>Even if you are taking regular full backups, the log file will grow and grow
until you perform a <em>log</em> backup - this is for your protection, not to
needlessly eat away at your disk space. You should be performing these log
backups quite frequently, according to your recovery objectives. For example,
if you have a business rule that states you can afford to lose no more than 15
minutes of data in the event of a disaster, you should have a job that backs
up the log every 15 minutes. Here is a script that will generate timestamped
file names based on the current time (but you can also do this with
maintenance plans etc., just don't choose any of the shrink options in
maintenance plans, they're awful).</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">DECLARE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">@path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">NVARCHAR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">N</span><span class="s1">'\\backup_share\log\testdb_'</span><span class="w"> </span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'.trn'</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Note that <code>\\backup_share\</code> should be on a different machine that represents a
different underlying storage device. Backing these up to the same machine (or
to a different machine that uses the same underlying disks, or a different VM
that's on the same physical host) does not really help you, since if the
machine blows up, you've lost your database <em>and</em> its backups. Depending on
your network infrastructure it may make more sense to backup locally and then
transfer them to a different location behind the scenes; in either case, you
want to get them off the primary database machine as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Now, once you have regular log backups running, it should be reasonable to
shrink the log file to something more reasonable than whatever it's blown up
to now. This does <em>not</em> mean running <code>SHRINKFILE</code> over and over again until
the log file is 1 MB - even if you are backing up the log frequently, it still
needs to accommodate the sum of any concurrent transactions that can occur.
Log file autogrow events are expensive, since SQL Server has to zero out the
files (unlike data files when instant file initialization is enabled), and
user transactions have to wait while this happens. You want to do this grow-
shrink-grow-shrink routine as little as possible, and you certainly don't want
to make your users pay for it.</p>
<p>Note that you may need to back up the log twice before a shrink is possible
(thanks Robert).</p>
<p>So, you need to come up with a practical size for your log file. Nobody here
can tell you what that is without knowing a lot more about your system, but if
you've been frequently shrinking the log file and it has been growing again, a
good watermark is probably 10-50% higher than the largest it's been. Let's say
that comes to 200 MB, and you want any subsequent autogrowth events to be 50
MB, then you can adjust the log file size this way:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">USE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">master</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">MODIFY</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FILE</span>

<span class="k">GO</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that if the log file is currently &gt; 200 MB, you may need to run this
first:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">USE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">yourdb</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">GO</span>
<span class="k">DBCC</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">SHRINKFILE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yourdb_log</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">GO</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>If you don't care about point-in-time recovery</h2>
<p>If this is a test database, and you don't care about point-in-time recovery,
then you should make sure that your database is in <code>SIMPLE</code> recovery mode.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ALTER DATABASE testdb SET RECOVERY SIMPLE;
</pre></div>

<p>Putting the database in <code>SIMPLE</code> recovery mode will make sure that SQL Server
re-uses portions of the log file (essentially phasing out inactive
transactions) instead of growing to keep a record of <em>all</em> transactions (like
<code>FULL</code> recovery does until you back up the log). <code>CHECKPOINT</code> events will help
control the log and make sure that it doesn't need to grow unless you generate
a lot of t-log activity between <code>CHECKPOINT</code>s.</p>
<p>Next, you should make absolute sure that this log growth was truly due to an
abnormal event (say, an annual spring cleaning or rebuilding your biggest
indexes), and not due to normal, everyday usage. If you shrink the log file to
a ridiculously small size, and SQL Server just has to grow it again to
accommodate your normal activity, what did you gain? Were you able to make use
of that disk space you freed up only temporarily? If you need an immediate
fix, then you can run the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">USE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">yourdb</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">GO</span>
<span class="k">CHECKPOINT</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">GO</span>
<span class="k">CHECKPOINT</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">run</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">twice</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ensure</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">wrap</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">around</span>
<span class="k">GO</span>
<span class="k">DBCC</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">SHRINKFILE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yourdb_log</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">unit</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">set</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">MBs</span>
<span class="k">GO</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Otherwise, set an appropriate size and growth rate. As per the example in the
point-in-time recovery case, you can use the same code and logic to determine
what file size is appropriate and set reasonable autogrowth parameters.</p>
<h2>Some things you don't want to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Back up the log with<code>TRUNCATE_ONLY</code> option and then <code>SHRINKFILE</code></strong>. For one, this <code>TRUNCATE_ONLY</code> option has been deprecated and is no longer available in current versions of SQL Server. Second, if you are in <code>FULL</code> recovery model, this will destroy your log chain and require a new, full backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detach the database, delete the log file, and re-attach</strong>. I can't emphasize how dangerous this can be. Your database may not come back up, it may come up as suspect, you may have to revert to a backup (if you have one), etc. etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the "shrink database" option</strong>. <code>DBCC SHRINKDATABASE</code> and the maintenance plan option to do the same are bad ideas, especially if you really only need to resolve a log problem issue. Target the file you want to adjust and adjust it independently, using <code>DBCC SHRINKFILE</code> or <code>ALTER DATABASE ... MODIFY FILE</code> (examples above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shrink the log file to 1 MB</strong>. This looks tempting because, hey, SQL Server will let me do it in certain scenarios, and look at all the space it frees! Unless your database is read only (and it is, you should mark it as such using <code>ALTER DATABASE</code>), this will absolutely just lead to many unnecessary growth events, as the log has to accommodate current transactions regardless of the recovery model. What is the point of freeing up that space temporarily, just so SQL Server can take it back slowly and painfully?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a second log file</strong>. This will provide temporarily relief for the drive that has filled your disk, but this is like trying to fix a punctured lung with a band-aid. You should deal with the problematic log file directly instead of just adding another potential problem. Other than redirecting some transaction log activity to a different drive, a second log file really does nothing for you (unlike a second data file), since only one of the files can ever be used at a time. Paul Randal also explains why multiple log files can bite you later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be proactive</h2>
<p>Instead of shrinking your log file to some small amount and letting it
constantly autogrow at a small rate on its own, set it to some reasonably
large size (one that will accommodate the sum of your largest set of
concurrent transactions) and set a reasonable autogrow setting as a fallback,
so that it doesn't have to grow multiple times to satisfy single transactions
and so that it will be relatively rare for it to ever have to grow during
normal business operations.</p>
<p>The worst possible settings here are 1 MB growth or 10% growth. Funny enough,
these are the defaults for SQL Server (which I've complained about and asked
for changes to no avail) - 1 MB for data files, and 10% for log files. The
former is much too small in this day and age, and the latter leads to longer
and longer events every time (say, your log file is 500 MB, first growth is 50
MB, next growth is 55 MB, next growth is 60.5 MB, etc. etc. - and on slow I/O,
believe me, you will really notice this curve).</p>
<h2>Further reading</h2>
<p>Please don't stop here; while much of the advice you see out there about
shrinking log files is inherently bad and even potentially disastrous, there
are some people who care more about data integrity than freeing up disk space.</p>
<p>A blog post I wrote in 2009, when I saw a few "here's how to shrink the log
file" posts spring up.</p>
<p>A blog post Brent Ozar wrote four years ago, pointing to multiple resources,
in response to a SQL Server Magazine article that should <em>not</em> have been
published.</p>
<p>A blog post by Paul Randal explaining why t-log maintenance is important and
why you shouldn't shrink your data files, either.</p>
<p>Mike Walsh has a great answer covering some of these aspects too, including
reasons why you might not be able to shrink your log file immediately.</p>
