<p>Also, what does <code>rebase</code> mean in comparison to <code>merge</code>?</p>
<p>How can I squash individual commits themselves together?</p>
<p>How are they used, why are they used and what do they represent?</p>
<p>How does GitHub figure in?</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A clone is simply a copy of a repository. On the surface, its result is
equivalent to <code>svn checkout</code>, where you download source code from some other
repository. The difference between centralized VCS like Subversion and DVCSs
like Git is that in Git, when you clone, you are actually copying the entire
source repository, including all the history and branches. You now have a new
repository on your machine and any commits you make go into that repository.
Nobody will see any changes until you push those commits to another repository
(or the original one) or until someone pulls commits from your repository, if
it is publicly accessible.</p>
<p>A branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents
a thread of development. You usually have a master branch, but you may also
have a branch where you are working on some feature xyz, and another one to
fix bug abc. When you have checked out a branch, any commits you make will
stay on that branch and not be shared with other branches until you merge them
with or rebase them onto the branch in question. Of course, Git seems a little
weird when it comes to branches until you look at the underlying model of how
branches are implemented. Rather than explain it myself (I've already said too
much, methinks), I'll link to the "computer science" explanation of how Git
models branches and commits, taken from the Git website:</p>
<p>http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/</p>
<p>A fork isn't a Git concept really, it's more a political/social idea. That is,
if some people aren't happy with the way a project is going, they can take the
source code and work on it themselves separate from the original developers.
That would be considered a fork. Git makes forking easy because everyone
already has their own "master" copy of the source code, so it's as simple as
cutting ties with the original project developers and doesn't require
exporting history from a shared repository like you might have to do with SVN.</p>
<p>EDIT: since I was not aware of the modern definition of "fork" as used by
sites such as GitHub, please take a look at the comments and also Michael
Durrant's answer below mine for more information.</p>
