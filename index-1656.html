    <p>When I run <code>maven install</code> on my multi module maven project I always get the
following output:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">WARNING</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">File</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">encoding</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">has</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">not</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">been</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">set</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">using</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">platform</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">encoding</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">UTF</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">build</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">is</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">platform</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">dependent</span><span class="err">!</span>

<p>So, I googled around a bit, but all I can find is that I have to add:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;properties&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;</span>UTF-8<span class="nt">&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/properties&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>...to my pom.xml. But it's already there (in the parent <code>pom.xml</code>).</p>
<p>Configuring <code>&lt;encoding&gt;</code> for the maven-resources-plugin or the maven-compiler-
plugin also doesn't fix it.</p>
<p>So what's the problem?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>OK, I have found the problem.</p>
<p>I use some reporting plugins. In the documentation of the <code>failsafe-maven-
plugin</code> I found, that the <code>&lt;encoding&gt;</code> configuration - of course - uses
<code>${project.reporting.outputEncoding}</code> by default.</p>
<p>So I added the property as a child element of the <code>project</code> element and
everything is fine now:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;properties&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;</span>UTF-8<span class="nt">&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;project.reporting.outputEncoding&gt;</span>UTF-8<span class="nt">&lt;/project.reporting.outputEncoding&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/properties&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This would be in addition to previous, if someone meets a problem with scandic
letters that isn't solved with the solution above.</p>
<p>If the java source files contain scandic letters they need to be interpreted
correctly by the <strong>Java used for compiling</strong>. (e.g. scandic letters used in
constants)</p>
<p>Even that the files are stored in UTF-8 and the Maven is configured to use
UTF-8, the System Java used by the Maven will still use the system default
(eg. in Windows: cp1252).</p>
<p>This will be visible only running the tests via maven (possibly printing the
values of these constants in tests. The printed scandic letters would show as
'&lt; ?&gt;') If not tested properly, this would corrupt the class files as compile
result and be left unnoticed.</p>
<p>To prevent this, you have to set the <strong>Java used for compiling</strong> to use UTF-8
encoding. It is not enough to have the encoding settings in the maven pom.xml,
you need to set the environment variable: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS =
-Dfile.encoding=UTF8</p>
<p>Also, if using Eclipse in Windows, you may need to set the encoding used in
addition to this (if you run individual test via eclipse).</p>

    <p><em>Cross-origin resource sharing</em> is a mechanism that allows a web page to make
XMLHttpRequests to another domain (from Wikipedia).</p>
<p>I've been fiddling with CORS for the last couple of days and I think I have a
pretty good understanding of how everything works.</p>
<p>So my question is not about how CORS / preflight work, it's about <strong>the reason
behind coming up with preflights as a new request type</strong>. I fail to see any
reason why server A needs to send a preflight (PR) to server B just to find
out if the real request (RR) will be accepted or not - it would certainly be
possible for B to accept/reject RR without any prior PR.</p>
<p>After searching quite a bit I found this piece of information at www.w3.org
(7.1.5):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To protect resources against cross-origin requests that could not originate
from certain user agents before this specification existed a preflight
request is made to ensure that the resource is aware of this specification.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this is the hardest to understand sentence ever. My interpretation
(should better call it 'best guess') is that it's about protecting server B
against requests from server C that is not aware of the spec.</p>
<p>Can someone please explain a scenario / show a problem that PR + RR solves
better than RR alone?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I spent some time being confused as to the purpose of the preflight request
but I think I've got it now.</p>
<p>The key insight is that preflight requests are not a <strong>security</strong> thing.
Rather, they're a <strong>not-changing-the-rules</strong> thing.</p>
<p>Preflight requests have nothing to do with security, and they have no bearing
on applications that are being developed now, with an awareness of CORS.
Rather, the preflight mechanism benefits servers that were developed <em>without</em>
an awareness of CORS, and it functions as a sanity check between the client
and the server that they are both CORS-aware. The developers of CORS felt that
there were enough servers out there that were relying on the assumption that
they would never receive, e.g. a cross-domain DELETE request that they
invented the preflight mechanism to allow both sides to opt-in. They felt that
the alternative, which would have been to simply enable the cross-domain
calls, would have broken too many existing applications.</p>
<p>There are three scenarios here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Old servers, no longer under development, and developed before CORS. These servers may make assumptions that they'll never receive e.g. a cross-domain DELETE request. <strong>This scenario is the primary beneficiary of the preflight mechanism.</strong> Yes these services could already be abused by a malicious or non-conforming user agent (and CORS does nothing to change this), but in a world with CORS the preflight mechanism provides an extra 'sanity check' so that clients and servers don't break because the underlying rules of the web have changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers that are still under development, but which contain a lot of old code and for which it's not feasible/desirable to audit all the old code to make sure it works properly in a cross-domain world. This scenario allows servers to progressively opt-in to CORS, e.g. by saying "Now I'll allow this particular header", "Now I'll allow this particular HTTP verb", "Now I'll allow cookies/auth information to be sent", etc. <strong>This scenario benefits from the preflight mechanism.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New servers that are written with an awareness of CORS. According to standard security practices, the server has to protect its resources in the face of <em>any</em> incoming request -- servers can't trust clients to not do malicious things. <strong>This scenario doesn't benefit from the preflight mechanism</strong> : the preflight mechanism brings no additional security to a server that has properly protected its resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>

<p><em><strong>What was the motivation behind introducing preflight requests?</strong></em></p>
<p>Preflight requests were introduced so that a browser could be sure it was
dealing with a CORS-aware server before sending certain requests. Those
requests were defined to be those that were both potentially dangerous (state-
changing) and new (not possible before CORS due to the Same Origin Policy).
Using preflight requests means that servers must opt-in (by responding
properly to the preflight) to the new, potentially dangerous types of request
that CORS makes possible.</p>
<p>That's the meaning of this part of the original specification: "To protect
resources against cross-origin requests that could not originate from certain
user agents before this specification existed a preflight request is made to
ensure that the resource is aware of this specification."</p>
<p><em><strong>Can you give me an example?</strong></em></p>
<p>Let's imagine that a browser user is logged into their banking site at
<code>A.com</code>. When they navigate to the malicious <code>B.com</code>, that page includes some
Javascript that tries to send a <code>DELETE</code> request to <code>A.com/account</code>. Since the
user is logged into <code>A.com</code>, that request, if sent, would include cookies that
identify the user.</p>
<p>Before CORS, the browser's Same Origin Policy would have blocked it from
sending this request. But since the purpose of CORS is to make just this kind
of cross-origin communication possible, that's no longer appropriate.</p>
<p>The browser <em>could</em> simply send the <code>DELETE</code> and let the server decide how to
handle it. But what if <code>A.com</code> isn't aware of the CORS protocol? It might go
ahead and execute the dangerous <code>DELETE</code>. It might have assumed that—due to
the browser's Same Origin Policy—it could never receive such a request, and
thus it might have never been hardened against such an attack.</p>
<p>To protect such non-CORS-aware servers, then, the protocol requires the
browser to first send a <em>preflight request</em>. This new kind of request is
something that only CORS-aware servers can respond to properly, allowing the
browser to know whether or not it's safe to send the actual <code>DELETE</code>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why all this fuss about the browser, can't the attacker just send a<code>DELETE</code>
request from their own computer?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sure, but such a request won't include the user's cookies. The attack that
this is designed to prevent relies on the fact that the browser will send
cookies (in particular, authentication information for the user) for the other
domain along with the request.</p>
<p><em><strong>That sounds like Cross-Site Request Forgery, where a form on site<code>B.com</code>
can be submitted to <code>A.com</code> with the user's cookies and do damage.</strong></em></p>
<p>That's right. Another way of putting this is that preflight requests were
created so as to not increase the CSRF attack surface for non-CORS-aware
servers.</p>
<p><em><strong>But<code>POST</code> is listed as a method that doesn't require preflights. That can
change state and delete data just like a <code>DELETE</code>!</strong></em></p>
<p>That's true! CORS does not protect your site from CSRF attacks. Then again,
without CORS you are also not protected from CSRF attacks. The purpose of
preflight requests is just to limit your CSRF exposure to what already existed
in the pre-CORS world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sigh. OK, I grudgingly accept the need for preflight requests. But why do
we have to do it for every resource (URL) on the server? The server either
handles CORS or it doesn't.</strong></em></p>
<p>Are you sure about that? It's not uncommon for multiple servers to handle
requests for a single domain. For example, it may be the case that requests to
<code>A.com/url1</code> are handled by one kind of server and requests to <code>A.com/url2</code>
are handled by a different kind of server. It's not generally the case that
the server handling a single resource can make security guarantees about all
resources on that domain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fine. Let's compromise. Let's create a new CORS header that allows the
server to state exactly which resources it can speak for, so that additional
preflight requests to those URLs can be avoided.</strong></em></p>
<p>Good idea! In fact, the header <code>Access-Control-Policy-Path</code> was proposed for
just this purpose. Ultimately, though, it was left out of the specification,
apparently because some servers incorrectly implemented the URI specification
in such a way that requests to paths that seemed safe to the browser would not
in fact be safe on the broken servers.</p>
<p>Was this a prudent decision that prioritized security over performance,
allowing browsers to immediately implement the CORS specification without
putting existing servers at risk? Or was it shortsighted to doom the internet
to wasted bandwidth and doubled latency just to accommodate bugs in a
particular server at a particular time?</p>
<p>Opinions differ.</p>
<p><em><strong>Well, at the very least browsers will cache the preflight for a single
URL?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. Though probably not for very long. In WebKit browsers the maximum
preflight cache time is currently 10 minutes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sigh. Well, if I know that my servers are CORS-aware, and therefore don't
need the protection offered by preflight requests, is there any way for me to
avoid them?</strong></em></p>
<p>Your only real option is to make sure that your requests use CORS-safe methods
and headers. That might mean leaving out custom headers that you would
otherwise include (like <code>X-Requested-With</code>), changing the <code>Content-Type</code>, or
more.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, you must make sure that you have proper CSRF protections in
place, since CORS will not block all unsafe requests. As the original
specification puts it: "resources for which simple requests have significance
other than retrieval must protect themselves from Cross-Site Request Forgery".</p>
