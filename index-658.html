    <p>The <code>man pages</code> and programmer documentations for the socket options
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> are different for different operating
systems and often highly confusing. Some operating systems don't even have the
option <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>. The WWW is full of contradicting information regarding
this subject and often you can find information that is only true for one
socket implementation of a specific operating system, which may not even be
explicitly mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>So how exactly is <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> different than <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>?</p>
<p>Are systems without <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> more limited?</p>
<p>And what exactly is the expected behavior if I use either one on different
operating systems?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of portability... or rather the lack of it.
Before we start analyzing these two options in detail and take a deeper look
how different operating systems handle them, it should be noted that the BSD
socket implementation is the mother of all socket implementations. Basically
all other systems copied the BSD socket implementation at some point in time
(or at least its interfaces) and then started evolving it on their own. Of
course the BSD socket implementation was evolved as well at the same time and
thus systems that copied it later got features that were lacking in systems
that copied it earlier. Understanding the BSD socket implementation is the key
to understanding all other socket implementations, so you should read about it
even if you don't care to ever write code for a BSD system.</p>
<p>There are a couple of basics you should know before we look at these two
options. A TCP/UDP connection is identified by a tuple of five values:</p>
<p><code>{&lt;protocol&gt;, &lt;src addr&gt;, &lt;src port&gt;, &lt;dest addr&gt;, &lt;dest port&gt;}</code></p>
<p>Any unique combination of these values identifies a connection. As a result,
no two connections can have the same five values, otherwise the system would
not be able to distinguish these connections any longer.</p>
<p>The protocol of a socket is set when a socket is created with the <code>socket()</code>
function. The source address and port are set with the <code>bind()</code> function. The
destination address and port are set with the <code>connect()</code> function. Since UDP
is a connectionless protocol, UDP sockets can be used without connecting them.
Yet it is allowed to connect them and in some cases very advantageous for your
code and general application design. In connectionless mode, UDP sockets that
were not explicitly bound when data is sent over them for the first time are
usually automatically bound by the system, as an unbound UDP socket cannot
receive any (reply) data. Same is true for an unbound TCP socket, it is
automatically bound before it will be connected.</p>
<p>If you explicitly bind a socket, it is possible to bind it to port <code>0</code>, which
means "any port". Since a socket cannot really be bound to all existing ports,
the system will have to choose a specific port itself in that case (usually
from a predefined, OS specific range of source ports). A similar wildcard
exists for the source address, which can be "any address" (<code>0.0.0.0</code> in case
of IPv4 and <code>::</code> in case of IPv6). Unlike in case of ports, a socket can
really be bound to "any address" which means "all source IP addresses of all
local interfaces". If the socket is connected later on, the system has to
choose a specific source IP address, since a socket cannot be connected and at
the same time be bound to any local IP address. Depending on the destination
address and the content of the routing table, the system will pick an
appropriate source address and replace the "any" binding with a binding to the
chosen source IP address.</p>
<p>By default, no two sockets can be bound to the same combination of source
address and source port. As long as the source port is different, the source
address is actually irrelevant. Binding <code>socketA</code> to <code>ipA:portA</code> and <code>socketB</code>
to <code>ipB:portB</code> is always possible if <code>ipA != ipB</code> holds true, even when <code>portA
== portB</code>. E.g. <code>socketA</code> belongs to a FTP server program and is bound to
<code>192.168.0.1:21</code> and <code>socketB</code> belongs to another FTP server program and is
bound to <code>10.0.0.1:21</code>, both bindings will succeed. Keep in mind, though, that
a socket may be locally bound to "any address". If a socket is bound to
<code>0.0.0.0:21</code>, it is bound to all existing local addresses at the same time and
in that case no other socket can be bound to port <code>21</code>, regardless which
specific IP address it tries to bind to, as <code>0.0.0.0</code> conflicts with all
existing local IP addresses.</p>
<p>Anything said so far is pretty much equal for all major operating system.
Things start to get OS specific when address reuse comes into play. We start
with BSD, since as I said above, it is the mother of all socket
implementations.</p>
<h2>BSD</h2>
<h3>SO_REUSEADDR</h3>
<p>If <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is enabled on a socket prior to binding it, the socket can
be successfully bound unless there is a conflict with another socket bound to
<strong>exactly</strong> the same combination of source address and port. Now you may
wonder how is that any different than before? The keyword is "exactly".
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> mainly changes the way how wildcard addresses ("any IP
address") are treated when searching for conflicts.</p>
<p>Without <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, binding <code>socketA</code> to <code>0.0.0.0:21</code> and then binding
<code>socketB</code> to <code>192.168.0.1:21</code> will fail (with error <code>EADDRINUSE</code>), since
0.0.0.0 means "any local IP address", thus all local IP addresses are
considered in use by this socket and this includes <code>192.168.0.1</code>, too. With
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will succeed, since <code>0.0.0.0</code> and <code>192.168.0.1</code> are <strong>not
exactly</strong> the same address, one is a wildcard for all local addresses and the
other one is a very specific local address. Note that the statement above is
true regardless in which order <code>socketA</code> and <code>socketB</code> are bound; without
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always fail, with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always
succeed.</p>
<p>To give you a better overview, let's make a table here and list all possible
combinations:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">SO_REUSEADDR       socketA        socketB       Result
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  ON/OFF       192.168.0.1:21   192.168.0.1:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)
  ON/OFF       192.168.0.1:21      10.0.0.1:21    OK
  ON/OFF          10.0.0.1:21   192.168.0.1:21    OK
   OFF             0.0.0.0:21   192.168.1.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)
   OFF         192.168.1.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)
   ON              0.0.0.0:21   192.168.1.0:21    OK
   ON          192.168.1.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    OK
  ON/OFF           0.0.0.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)
</pre></div>

<p>The table above assumes that <code>socketA</code> has already been successfully bound to
the address given for <code>socketA</code>, then <code>socketB</code> is created, either gets
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set or not, and finally is bound to the address given for
<code>socketB</code>. <code>Result</code> is the result of the bind operation for <code>socketB</code>. If the
first column says <code>ON/OFF</code>, the value of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is irrelevant to the
result.</p>
<p>Okay, <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> has an effect on wildcard addresses, good to know. Yet
that isn't its only effect it has. There is another well known effect which is
also the reason why most people use <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> in server programs in the
first place. For the other important use of this option we have to take a
deeper look on how the TCP protocol works.</p>
<p>If a TCP socket is being closed, normally a 3-way handshake is performed; the
sequence is called <code>FIN-ACK</code>. The problem here is, that the last ACK of that
sequence may have arrived on the other side or it may not have arrived and
only if it has, the other side also considers the socket as being fully
closed. To prevent re-using an address+port combination, that may still be
considered open by some remote peer, the system will not immediately consider
a socket as dead after sending the last <code>ACK</code> but instead put the socket into
a state commonly referred to as <code>TIME_WAIT</code>. It can be in that state for
minutes (system dependent setting). On most systems you can get around that
state by enabling lingering and setting a linger time of zero1 but there is no
guarantee that this is always possible, that the system will always honor this
request, and even if the system honors it, this causes the socket to be closed
by a reset (<code>RST</code>), which is not always a great idea. To learn more about
linger time, have a look at my answer about this topic.</p>
<p>The question is, how does the system treat a socket in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code>? If
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is not set, a socket in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code> is considered to
still be bound to the source address and port and any attempt to bind a new
socket to the same address and port will fail until the socket has really been
closed. So don't expect that you can rebind the source address of a socket
immediately after closing it. In most cases this will fail. However, if
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is set for the socket you are trying to bind, another socket
bound to the same address and port in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code> is simply ignored,
after all its already "half dead", and your socket can bind to exactly the
same address without any problem. In that case it plays no role that the other
socket may have exactly the same address and port. Note that binding a socket
to exactly the same address and port as a dying socket in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state
can have unexpected, and usually undesired, side effects in case the other
socket is still "at work", but that is beyond the scope of this answer and
fortunately those side effects are rather rare in practice.</p>
<p>There is one final thing you should know about <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. Everything
written above will work as long as the socket you want to bind to has address
reuse enabled. It is not necessary that the other socket, the one which is
already bound or is in a <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state, also had this flag set when it was
bound. The code that decides if the bind will succeed or fail only inspects
the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> flag of the socket fed into the <code>bind()</code> call, for all
other sockets inspected, this flag is not even looked at.</p>
<h3>SO_REUSEPORT</h3>
<p><code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> is what most people would expect <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> to be.
Basically, <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> allows you to bind an arbitrary number of sockets to
<strong>exactly</strong> the same source address and port as long as <strong>all</strong> prior bound
sockets also had <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set before they were bound. If the first
socket that is bound to an address and port does not have <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set,
no other socket can be bound to exactly the same address and port, regardless
if this other socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set or not, until the first socket
releases its binding again. Unlike in case of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> the code handling
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> will not only verify that the currently bound socket has
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set but it will also verify that the socket with a conflicting
address and port had <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it was bound.</p>
<p><code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> does not imply <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. This means if a socket did not
have <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it was bound and another socket has
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it is bound to exactly the same address and port, the
bind fails, which is expected, but it also fails if the other socket is
already dying and is in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state. To be able to bind a socket to the
same addresses and port as another socket in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state requires either
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> to be set on that socket or <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> must have been set
<strong>on both</strong> sockets prior to binding them. Of course it is allowed to set
both, <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, on a socket.</p>
<p>There is not much more to say about <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> other than that it was
added later than <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, that's why you will not find it in many
socket implementations of other systems, which "forked" the BSD code before
this option was added, and that there was no way to bind two sockets to
exactly the same socket address in BSD prior to this option.</p>
<h3>Connect() Returning EADDRINUSE?</h3>
<p>Most people know that <code>bind()</code> may fail with the error <code>EADDRINUSE</code>, however,
when you start playing around with address reuse, you may run into the strange
situation that <code>connect()</code> fails with that error as well. How can this be? How
can a remote address, after all that's what connect adds to a socket, be
already in use? Connecting multiple sockets to exactly the same remote address
has never been a problem before, so what's going wrong here?</p>
<p>As I said on the very top of my reply, a connection is defined by a tuple of
five values, remember? And I also said, that these five values must be unique
otherwise the system cannot distinguish two connections any longer, right?
Well, with address reuse, you can bind two sockets of the same protocol to the
same source address and port. That means three of those five values are
already the same for these two sockets. If you now try to connect both of
these sockets also to the same destination address and port, you would create
two connected sockets, whose tuples are absolutely identical. This cannot
work, at least not for TCP connections (UDP connections are no real
connections anyway). If data arrived for either one of the two connections,
the system could not tell which connection the data belongs to. At least the
destination address or destination port must be different for either
connection, so that the system has no problem to identify to which connection
incoming data belongs to.</p>
<p>So if you bind two sockets of the same protocol to the same source address and
port and try to connect them both to the same destination address and port,
<code>connect()</code> will actually fail with the error <code>EADDRINUSE</code> for the second
socket you try to connect, which means that a socket with an identical tuple
of five values is already connected.</p>
<h3>Multicast Addresses</h3>
<p>Most people ignore the fact that multicast addresses exist, but they do exist.
While unicast addresses are used for one-to-one communication, multicast
addresses are used for one-to-many communication. Most people got aware of
multicast addresses when they learned about IPv6 but multicast addresses also
existed in IPv4, even though this feature was never widely used on the public
Internet.</p>
<p>The meaning of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> changes for multicast addresses as it allows
multiple sockets to be bound to exactly the same combination of source
multicast address and port. In other words, for multicast addresses
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves exactly as <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> for unicast addresses.
Actually, the code treats <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> identically for
multicast addresses, that means you could say that <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> implies
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> for all multicast addresses and the other way round.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD</p>
<p>All these are rather late forks of the original BSD code, that's why they all
three offer the same options as BSD and they also behave the same way as in
BSD.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>macOS (MacOS X)</p>
<p>At its core, macOS is simply a BSD-style UNIX named " <em>Darwin</em> ", based on a
rather late fork of the BSD code (BSD 4.3), which was then later on even re-
synchronized with the (at that time current) FreeBSD 5 code base for the Mac
OS 10.3 release, so that Apple could gain full POSIX compliance (macOS is
POSIX certified). Despite having a microkernel at its core (" <em>Mach</em> "), the
rest of the kernel (" <em>XNU</em> ") is basically just a BSD kernel, and that's why
macOS offers the same options as BSD and they also behave the same way as in
BSD.</p>
<h3>iOS / watchOS / tvOS</h3>
<p>iOS is just a macOS fork with a slightly modified and trimmed kernel, somewhat
stripped down user space toolset and a slightly different default framework
set. watchOS and tvOS are iOS forks, that are stripped down even further
(especially watchOS). To my best knowledge they all behave exactly as macOS
does.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Linux</p>
<h3>Linux &lt; 3.9</h3>
<p>Prior to Linux 3.9, only the option <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> existed. This option
behaves generally the same as in BSD with two important exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As long as a listening (server) TCP socket is bound to a specific port, the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> option is entirely ignored for all sockets targeting that port. Binding a second socket to the same port is only possible if it was also possible in BSD without having <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set. E.g. you cannot bind to a wildcard address and then to a more specific one or the other way round, both is possible in BSD if you set <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. What you can do is you can bind to the same port and two different non-wildcard addresses, as that's always allowed. In this aspect Linux is more restrictive than BSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second exception is that for client sockets, this option behaves exactly like <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> in BSD, as long as both had this flag set before they were bound. The reason for allowing that was simply that it is important to be able to bind multiple sockets to exactly to the same UDP socket address for various protocols and as there used to be no <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> prior to 3.9, the behavior of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> was altered accordingly to fill that gap. In that aspect Linux is less restrictive than BSD.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Linux &gt;= 3.9</h3>
<p>Linux 3.9 added the option <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> to Linux as well. This option
behaves exactly like the option in BSD and allows binding to exactly the same
address and port number as long as all sockets have this option set prior to
binding them.</p>
<p>Yet, there are still two differences to <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> on other systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To prevent "port hijacking", there is one special limitation: <strong>All sockets that want to share the same address and port combination must belong to processes that share the same effective user ID!</strong> So one user cannot "steal" ports of another user. This is some special magic to somewhat compensate for the missing <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code>/<code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code> flags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally the kernel performs some "special magic" for <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> sockets that isn't found in other operating systems: For UDP sockets, it tries to distribute datagrams evenly, for TCP listening sockets, it tries to distribute incoming connect requests (those accepted by calling <code>accept()</code>) evenly across all the sockets that share the same address and port combination. Thus an application can easily open the same port in multiple child processes and then use <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> to get a very inexpensive load balancing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3></h3>
<p>Android</p>
<p>Even though the whole Android system is somewhat different from most Linux
distributions, at its core works a slightly modified Linux kernel, thus
everything that applies to Linux should apply to Android as well.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>Windows only knows the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> option, there is no <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>.
Setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on a socket in Windows behaves like setting
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on a socket in BSD, with one exception:</p>
<p>Prior to Windows 2003, a socket with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> could always been bound to
exactly the same source address and port as an already bound socket, <strong>even if
the other socket did not have this option set when it was bound</strong>. This
behavior allowed an application "to steal" the connected port of another
application. Needless to say that this has major security implications!</p>
<p>Microsoft realized that and added another important socket option:
<code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code>. Setting <code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code> on a socket makes sure
that if the binding succeeds, the combination of source address and port is
owned exclusively by this socket and no other socket can bind to them, <strong>not
even</strong> if it has <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set.</p>
<p>This default behavior was changed first in Windows 2003, Microsoft calls that
"Enhanced Socket Security" (funny name for a behavior that is default on all
other major operating systems). For more details just visit this page. There
are three tables: The first one shows the classic behavior (still in use when
using compatibility modes!), the second one shows the behavior of Windows 2003
and up when the <code>bind()</code> calls are made by the same user, and the third one
when the <code>bind()</code> calls are made by different users.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Solaris</p>
<p>Solaris is the successor of SunOS. SunOS was originally based on a fork of
BSD, SunOS 5 and later was based on a fork of SVR4, however SVR4 is a merge of
BSD, System V, and Xenix, so up to some degree Solaris is also a BSD fork, and
a rather early one. As a result Solaris only knows <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, there is no
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>. The <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves pretty much the same as it does in
BSD. As far as I know there is no way to get the same behavior as
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> in Solaris, that means it is not possible to bind two sockets
to exactly the same address and port.</p>
<p>Similar to Windows, Solaris has an option to give a socket an exclusive
binding. This option is named <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code>. If this option is set on a socket
prior to binding it, setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on another socket has no effect if
the two sockets are tested for an address conflict. E.g. if <code>socketA</code> is bound
to a wildcard address and <code>socketB</code> has <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> enabled and is bound to
a non-wildcard address and the same port as <code>socketA</code>, this bind will normally
succeed, unless <code>socketA</code> had <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code> enabled, in which case it will
fail regardless the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> flag of <code>socketB</code>.</p>

<p>Other Systems</p>
<p>In case your system is not listed above, I wrote a little test program that
you can use to find out how your system handles these two options. <strong>Also if
you think my results are wrong</strong> , please first run that program before
posting any comments and possibly making false claims.</p>
<p>All that the code requires to build is a bit POSIX API (for the network parts)
and a C99 compiler (actually most non-C99 compiler will work as well as long
as they offer <code>inttypes.h</code> and <code>stdbool.h</code>; e.g. <code>gcc</code> supported both long
before offering full C99 support).</p>
<p>All that the program needs to run is that at least one interface in your
system (other than the local interface) has an IP address assigned and that a
default route is set which uses that interface. The program will gather that
IP address and use it as the second "specific address".</p>
<p>It tests all possible combinations you can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP and UDP protocol</li>
<li>Normal sockets, listen (server) sockets, multicast sockets</li>
<li>
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set on socket1, socket2, or both sockets</li>
<li>
<code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set on socket1, socket2, or both sockets</li>
<li>All address combinations you can make out of <code>0.0.0.0</code> (wildcard), <code>127.0.0.1</code> (specific address), and the second specific address found at your primary interface (for multicast it's just <code>224.1.2.3</code> in all tests)</li>
</ul>
<p>and prints the results in a nice table. It will also work on systems that
don't know <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>, in which case this option is simply not tested.</p>
<p>What the program cannot easily test is how <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> acts on sockets in
<code>TIME_WAIT</code> state as it's very tricky to force and keep a socket in that
state. Fortunately most operating systems seems to simply behave like BSD here
and most of the time programmers can simply ignore the existence of that
state.</p>
<p>Here's the code (I cannot include it here, answers have a size limit and the
code would push this reply over the limit).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Mecki's answer is absolutly perfect, but it's worth adding that FreeBSD also
supports <code>SO_REUSEPORT_LB</code>, which mimics Linux' <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> behaviour - it
balances the load; see setsockopt(2)</p>

    <p>I finally managed to obfuscate my Android application, now I want to test it
by installing the APK file and running it on the emulator.</p>
<p>How can I install an APK file on the Android Emulator?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>You can simply drag and drop the .apk file of your application to the
emulator and it will automatically start installing.</strong></p>
<p>Another option:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the emulator (SDK Manager.exe-&gt;Tools-&gt;Manage AVDs...-&gt;New then Start)</li>
<li>Start the console (Windows XP), Run -&gt; type <strong>cmd</strong> , and move to the <strong>platform-tools</strong> folder of <strong>SDK</strong> directory.</li>
<li>Paste the <em>APK</em> file in the 'android-sdk\tools' or 'platform-tools' folder.</li>
<li>Then type the following command.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>adb install [.apk path]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>adb install C:\Users\Name\MyProject\build\Jorgesys.apk</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Linux:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the apk file to <code>platform-tools</code> in the <code>android-sdk linux</code> folder.</li>
<li>Open <strong>Terminal</strong> and <strong>navigate to platform-tools</strong> folder in <strong>android-sdk</strong>.</li>
<li>Then Execute this command -</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>./adb install FileName.apk</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>If the operation is successful (the result is displayed on the screen), then you will find your file in the launcher of your emulator.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mac:</strong></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">PATH</span><span class="o">=$</span><span class="n">PATH</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">~/</span><span class="n">Library</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Android</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sdk</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">platform</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tools</span>
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Example : PATH=$PATH:/users/jorgesys/eclipse/android-sdk-mac_64/tools</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then run adb.</p>
<p>Mac:</p>
<p>1.Run the emulator,</p>
<p>2.then copy your .apk file and paste into
<code>/Users/your_system_username/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools</code>,<br>
if you are not able to find sdk path in your mac system, do the following
steps: Open <code>finder-&gt;select</code> Go option on top menu -&gt; select Go to Folder
option -&gt; it will popup a window with a textfield:
<code>/Users/your_system_username/Library/Android/sdk/</code> -&gt; now open platform-tools
folder and paste your copied .apk file,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Now open the terminal and type the following: <code>cd Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>execute the following in your terminal: <code>./adb install yourapkfilename.apk</code> if you get the following error message: <code>error: no devices found - waiting for device</code>, follow step 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your emulator from Android Studio, once emulator active then repeat step 4, you will see the success message on your terminal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>If you've created more than one emulators or if you have an Android device
plugged in, adb will complain with</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">more</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">than</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">one</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">device</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">emulator</span>
</pre></div>

<p><code>adb help</code> is not extremely clear on what to do:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">-d                        - directs command to the only connected USB device...
-e                        - directs command to the only running emulator...
-s &lt;serial number&gt;        ...
-p &lt;product name or path&gt; ...
</pre></div>

<p>The flag you decide to use has to come <strong>before</strong> the actual adb command:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">adb -e install path/to/app.apk

    <p>I am seeking an example of something that can be done with an <code>IntentService</code>
that cannot be done with a <code>Service</code> (and vice-versa)?</p>
<p>I also believe that an <code>IntentService</code> runs in a different thread and a
<code>Service</code> does not. So, as far as I can see, starting a service within its own
thread is like starting an <code>IntentService</code>. Is that correct?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Tejas Lagvankar wrote a nice post about this subject. Below are some key
differences between Service and IntentService.</p>
<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Service</em> can be used in tasks with no UI, but shouldn't be too long. If you need to perform long tasks, you must use threads within Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>IntentService</em> can be used in long tasks usually with no communication to Main Thread. If communication is required, can use Main Thread handler or broadcast intents. Another case of use is when callbacks are needed (Intent triggered tasks).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to trigger?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Service</em> is triggered by calling method <code>startService()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>IntentService</em> is triggered using an Intent, it spawns a new worker thread and the method <code>onHandleIntent()</code> is called on this thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Triggered From</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Service</em> and <em>IntentService</em> may be triggered from any thread, activity or other application component.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Runs On</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Service</em> runs in background but it runs on the Main Thread of the application. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>IntentService</em> runs on a separate worker thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations / Drawbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Service</em> may block the Main Thread of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>IntentService</em> cannot run tasks in parallel. Hence all the consecutive intents will go into the message queue for the worker thread and will execute sequentially.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to stop?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you implement a <em>Service</em> , it is your responsibility to stop the service when its work is done, by calling <code>stopSelf()</code> or <code>stopService()</code>. (If you only want to provide binding, you don't need to implement this method).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>IntentService</em> stops the service after all start requests have been handled, so you never have to call <code>stopSelf()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<p>If someone can show me an example of something that can be done with an
<code>IntentService</code> and can not be done with a <code>Service</code> and the other way
around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition, that is impossible. <code>IntentService</code> is a subclass of <code>Service</code>,
written in Java. Hence, anything an <code>IntentService</code> does, a <code>Service</code> could
do, by including the relevant bits of code that <code>IntentService</code> uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting a service with its own thread is like starting an IntentService. Is
it not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three primary features of an <code>IntentService</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the background thread</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the automatic queuing of <code>Intent</code>s delivered to <code>onStartCommand()</code>, so if one <code>Intent</code> is being processed by <code>onHandleIntent()</code> on the background thread, other commands queue up waiting their turn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the automatic shutdown of the <code>IntentService</code>, via a call to <code>stopSelf()</code>, once the queue is empty</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any and all of that could be implemented by a <code>Service</code> without extending
<code>IntentService</code>.</p>
