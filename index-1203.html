    <p>Is there any way I can do</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git add -A

<p>in one command?</p>
<p>I seem to be doing those two commands a lot, and if Git had an option like
<code>git commit -Am "commit message"</code>, it would make life that much more
convenient.</p>
<p><code>git commit</code> has the <code>-a</code> modifier, but it doesn't quite do the same as doing
<code>git add -A</code> before committing. <code>git add -A</code> adds newly created files, but
<code>git commit -am</code> does not. What does?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You can use git aliases, e.g.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git config --global alias.add-commit '!git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit'
</pre></div>

<p>and use it with</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git add-commit -m 'My commit message'
</pre></div>

<hr>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Reverted back to ticks ('), as otherwise it will fail for shell
expansion on Linux. <strong>On Windows</strong> , one should use <strong>double-quotes (")</strong>
instead (pointed out in the comments, did not verify).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git commit -am "message"
</pre></div>

<p>is an easy way to tell git to delete files you have deleted, but I generally
don't recommend such catch-all workflows. Git commits should in best practice
be fairly atomic and only affect a few files.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git add .
git commit -m "message"
</pre></div>

<p>is an easy way to add all files new or modified. Also, the catch-all
qualification applies. The above commands will not delete files deleted
without the <code>git rm</code> command.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git add app
git commit -m "message"
</pre></div>

<p>is an easy way to add all files to the index from a single dir, in this case
the <code>app</code> dir.</p>

    <p>Some Git commands take commit ranges and one valid syntax is to separate two
commit names with two dots <code>..</code>, and another syntax uses three dots <code>...</code>.</p>
<p>What are the differences between the two?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>It depends on whether you're using a <code>log</code> command or a <code>diff</code> command. In the
<code>log</code> case, it's in the <code>man git-rev-parse</code> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix ^ notation is used.
E.g. ^r1 r2 means commits reachable from r2 but exclude the ones reachable
from r1.</p>
<p>This set operation appears so often that there is a shorthand for it. When
you have two commits r1 and r2 (named according to the syntax explained in
SPECIFYING REVISIONS above), you can ask for commits that are reachable from
r2 excluding those that are reachable from r1 by "^r1 r2" and it can be
written as "r1..r2".</p>
<p>A similar notation "r1...r2" is called symmetric difference of r1 and r2 and
is defined as "r1 r2 --not $(git merge-base --all r1 r2)". It is the set of
commits that are reachable from either one of r1 or r2 but not from both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which basically means that you'll get all commits that are in either of the
two branches, but not in both.</p>
<p>In the <code>diff</code> case, it's in the <code>man git-diff</code> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">  git diff [--options] &lt;commit&gt;...&lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]

      This form is to view the changes on the branch containing and up
</pre></div>

<p>to
          the second <commit>, starting at a common ancestor of both
          <commit>. "git diff A...B" is equivalent to "git diff
          $(git-merge-base A B) B". You can omit any one of <commit>, which
          has the same effect as using HEAD instead.
</commit></commit></commit></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is a bit fuzzy. Basically it means it shows only the differences in that
branch compared to another branch: it looks for the last common commit with
the first committish you gave it, and then diffs the second committish to
that. It's an easy way to see what changes are made in that branch, compared
to this branch, without taking notice of changes in this branch only.</p>
<p>The <code>..</code> is somewhat simpler: In the <code>git-diff</code> case, it's the same as a <code>git
diff A B</code> and just diffs A against B. In the <code>log</code> case, it shows all commits
that are in B but not in A.</p>

<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There's an input stream decorator, <code>java.security.DigestInputStream</code>, so that
you can compute the digest while using the input stream as you normally would,
instead of having to make an extra pass over the data.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(Paths.get("file.txt"));
     DigestInputStream dis = new DigestInputStream(is, md)) 
{
  /* Read decorated stream (dis) to EOF as normal... */
}
byte[] digest = md.digest();
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Use DigestUtils from Apache Commons Codec library:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(Paths.get("file.zip"))) {
    String md5 = org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.md5Hex(is);
}
