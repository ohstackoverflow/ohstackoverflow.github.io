    <p><strong>This question's answers are a community effort</strong>. Edit existing answers to

<p>For a few days I've tried to wrap my head around the functional programming
paradigm in Haskell. I've done this by reading tutorials and watching
screencasts, but nothing really seems to stick. Now, in learning various
imperative/OO languages (like C, Java, PHP), exercises have been a good way
for me to go. But since I don't really know what Haskell is capable of and
because there are many new concepts to utilize, I haven't known where to
start.</p>
<p>So, how did you learn Haskell? What made you really "break the ice"? Also, any
good ideas for beginning exercises?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I'm going to order this guide by the level of skill you have in Haskell, going
from an absolute beginner right up to an expert. Note that this process will
take many months (years?), so it is rather long.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Beginner</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, Haskell is capable of anything, with enough skill. It is very fast
(behind only C and C++ in my experience), and can be used for anything from
simulations to servers, guis and web applications.</p>
<p>However there are some problems that are easier to write for a beginner in
Haskell than others. Mathematical problems and list process programs are good
candidates for this, as they only require the most basic of Haskell knowledge
to be able to write.</p>
<p>Some good guides to learning the very basics of Haskell are the Happy Learn
Haskell Tutorial and the first 6 chapters of Learn You a Haskell for Great
Good (or its JupyterLab adaptation). While reading these, it is a very good
idea to also be solving simple problems with what you know.</p>
<p>Another two good resources are Haskell Programming from first principles, and
Programming in Haskell. They both come with exercises for each chapter, so you
have small simple problems matching what you learned on the last few pages.</p>
<p>A good list of problems to try is the haskell 99 problems page. These start
off very basic, and get more difficult as you go on. It is very good practice
doing a lot of those, as they let you practice your skills in recursion and
higher order functions. I would recommend skipping any problems that require
randomness as that is a bit more difficult in Haskell. Check this SO question
in case you want to test your solutions with QuickCheck (see <em>Intermediate</em>
below).</p>
<p>Once you have done a few of those, you could move on to doing a few of the
Project Euler problems. These are sorted by how many people have completed
them, which is a fairly good indication of difficulty. These test your logic
and Haskell more than the previous problems, but you should still be able to
do the first few. A big advantage Haskell has with these problems is Integers
aren't limited in size. To complete some of these problems, it will be useful
to have read chapters 7 and 8 of learn you a Haskell as well.</p>
<p><strong>Beginner</strong></p>
<p>After that you should have a fairly good handle on recursion and higher order
functions, so it would be a good time to start doing some more real world
problems. A very good place to start is Real World Haskell (online book, you
can also purchase a hard copy). I found the first few chapters introduced too
much too quickly for someone who has never done functional programming/used
recursion before. However with the practice you would have had from doing the
previous problems you should find it perfectly understandable.</p>
<p>Working through the problems in the book is a great way of learning how to
manage abstractions and building reusable components in Haskell. This is vital
for people used to object-orientated (oo) programming, as the normal oo
abstraction methods (oo classes) don't appear in Haskell (Haskell has type
classes, but they are very different to oo classes, more like oo interfaces).
I don't think it is a good idea to skip chapters, as each introduces a lot new
ideas that are used in later chapters.</p>
<p>After a while you will get to chapter 14, the dreaded monads chapter (dum dum
dummmm). Almost everyone who learns Haskell has trouble understanding monads,
due to how abstract the concept is. I can't think of any concept in another
language that is as abstract as monads are in functional programming. Monads
allows many ideas (such as IO operations, computations that might fail,
parsing,...) to be unified under one idea. So don't feel discouraged if after
reading the monads chapter you don't really understand them. I found it useful
to read many different explanations of monads; each one gives a new
perspective on the problem. Here is a very good list of monad tutorials. I
highly recommend the All About Monads, but the others are also good.</p>
<p>Also, it takes a while for the concepts to truly sink in. This comes through
use, but also through time. I find that sometimes sleeping on a problem helps
more than anything else! Eventually, the idea will click, and you will wonder
why you struggled to understand a concept that in reality is incredibly
simple. It is awesome when this happens, and when it does, you might find
Haskell to be your favorite imperative programming language :)</p>
<p>To make sure that you are understanding Haskell type system perfectly, you
should try to solve 20 intermediate haskell exercises. Those exercises using
fun names of functions like "furry" and "banana" and helps you to have a good
understanding of some basic functional programming concepts if you don't have
them already. Nice way to spend your evening with a bunch of papers covered
with arrows, unicorns, sausages and furry bananas.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate</strong></p>
<p>Once you understand Monads, I think you have made the transition from a
beginner Haskell programmer to an intermediate haskeller. So where to go from
here? The first thing I would recommend (if you haven't already learnt them
from learning monads) is the various types of monads, such as Reader, Writer
and State. Again, Real world Haskell and All about monads gives great coverage
of this. To complete your monad training learning about monad transformers is
a must. These let you combine different types of Monads (such as a Reader and
State monad) into one. This may seem useless to begin with, but after using
them for a while you will wonder how you lived without them.</p>
<p>Now you can finish the real world Haskell book if you want. Skipping chapters
now doesn't really matter, as long as you have monads down pat. Just choose
what you are interested in.</p>
<p>With the knowledge you would have now, you should be able to use most of the
packages on cabal (well the documented ones at least...), as well as most of
the libraries that come with Haskell. A list of interesting libraries to try
would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parsec: for parsing programs and text. Much better than using regexps. Excellent documentation, also has a real world Haskell chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QuickCheck: A very cool testing program. What you do is write a predicate that should always be true (eg <code>length (reverse lst) == length lst</code>). You then pass the predicate the QuickCheck, and it will generate a lot of random values (in this case lists) and test that the predicate is true for all results. See also the online manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HUnit: Unit testing in Haskell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gtk2hs: The most popular gui framework for Haskell, lets you write gtk applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>happstack: A web development framework for Haskell. Doesn't use databases, instead a data type store. Pretty good docs (other popular frameworks would be snap and yesod).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there are many concepts (like the Monad concept) that you should
eventually learn. This will be easier than learning Monads the first time, as
your brain will be used to dealing with the level of abstraction involved. A
very good overview for learning about these high level concepts and how they
fit together is the Typeclassopedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Applicative: An interface like Monads, but less powerful. Every Monad is Applicative, but not vice versa. This is useful as there are some types that are Applicative but are not Monads. Also, code written using the Applicative functions is often more composable than writing the equivalent code using the Monad functions. See Functors, Applicative Functors and Monoids from the learn you a haskell guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foldable,Traversable: Typeclasses that abstract many of the operations of lists, so that the same functions can be applied to other container types. See also the haskell wiki explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monoid: A Monoid is a type that has a zero (or mempty) value, and an operation, notated <code>&lt;&gt;</code> that joins two Monoids together, such that <code>x &lt;&gt; mempty = mempty &lt;&gt; x = x</code> and <code>x &lt;&gt; (y &lt;&gt; z) = (x &lt;&gt; y) &lt;&gt; z</code>. These are called identity and associativity laws. Many types are Monoids, such as numbers, with <code>mempty = 0</code> and <code>&lt;&gt; = +</code>. This is useful in many situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrows: Arrows are a way of representing computations that take an input and return an output. A function is the most basic type of arrow, but there are many other types. The library also has many very useful functions for manipulating arrows - they are very useful even if only used with plain old Haskell functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrays: the various mutable/immutable arrays in Haskell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ST Monad: lets you write code with a mutable state that runs very quickly, while still remaining pure outside the monad. See the link for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FRP: Functional Reactive Programming, a new, experimental way of writing code that handles events, triggers, inputs and outputs (such as a gui). I don't know much about this though. Paul Hudak's talk about yampa is a good start.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of new language features you should have a look at. I'll just
list them, you can find lots of info about them from google, the haskell
wikibook, the haskellwiki.org site and ghc documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiparameter type classes/functional dependencies</li>
<li>Type families</li>
<li>Existentially quantified types</li>
<li>Phantom types</li>
<li>GADTS</li>
<li>others...</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of Haskell is based around category theory, so you may want to look into
that. A good starting point is Category Theory for Computer Scientist. If you
don't want to buy the book, the author's related article is also excellent.</p>
<p>Finally you will want to learn more about the various Haskell tools. These
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ghc (and all its features)</li>
<li>cabal: the Haskell package system</li>
<li>darcs: a distributed version control system written in Haskell, very popular for Haskell programs.</li>
<li>haddock: a Haskell automatic documentation generator</li>
</ul>
<p>While learning all these new libraries and concepts, it is very useful to be
writing a moderate-sized project in Haskell. It can be anything (e.g. a small
game, data analyser, website, compiler). Working on this will allow you to
apply many of the things you are now learning. You stay at this level for ages
(this is where I'm at).</p>
<p><strong>Expert</strong></p>
<p>It will take you years to get to this stage (hello from 2009!), but from here
I'm guessing you start writing phd papers, new ghc extensions, and coming up
with new abstractions.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>
<p>Finally, while at any stage of learning, there are multiple places for getting
information. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the #haskell irc channel</li>
<li>the mailing lists. These are worth signing up for just to read the discussions that take place - some are very interesting.</li>
<li>other places listed on the haskell.org home page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well this turned out longer than I expected... Anyway, I think it is a very
good idea to become proficient in Haskell. It takes a long time, but that is
mainly because you are learning a completely new way of thinking by doing so.
It is not like learning Ruby after learning Java, but like learning Java after
learning C. Also, I am finding that my object-orientated programming skills
have improved as a result of learning Haskell, as I am seeing many new ways of
abstracting ideas.</p>

<p>Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for

<p>Let's see if I understand this correctly.</p>
<p>Here is my understanding of a checked exception:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">try{
    String userInput = //read in user input
    Long id = Long.parseLong(userInput);

<p><strong>1. Is the above considered a checked exception?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Is RuntimeException an unchecked exception?</strong></p>
<p>Here is my understanding of an unchecked exception:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">try</span>{
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">File</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">File</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s2">"my/file/path"</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>

</pre></div>

<p><strong>4. Now, couldn't the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to
recover the situation like this? Can I?</strong> (Note: my 3rd question is inside the
<code>catch</code> above)</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">try{
    String filePath = //read in from user input file path
    File file = new File(filePath);
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
    //Kindly prompt the user an error message
    //Somehow ask the user to re-enter the file path.
}
</pre></div>

<p><strong>5. Why do people do this?</strong></p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public void someMethod throws Exception{

}
</pre></div>

<p>Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner
better? Why bubble up?</p>
<p><strong>6. Should I bubble up the exact exception or mask it using Exception?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Below are my readings</strong></p>
<p>In Java, when should I create a checked exception, and when should it be a
runtime exception?</p>
<p>When to choose checked and unchecked exceptions</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Many people say that checked exceptions (i.e. these that you should explicitly
catch or rethrow) should not be used at all. They were eliminated in C# for
example, and most languages don't have them. So you can always throw a
subclass of <code>RuntimeException</code> (unchecked exception)</p>
<p>However, I think checked exceptions are useful - they are used when you want
to force the user of your API to think how to handle the exceptional situation
(if it is recoverable). It's just that checked exceptions are overused in the
Java platform, which makes people hate them.</p>
<p>Here's my extended view on the topic.</p>
<p>As for the particular questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the<code>NumberFormatException</code> consider a checked exception?</strong><br>
No. <code>NumberFormatException</code> is unchecked (= is subclass of
<code>RuntimeException</code>). Why? I don't know. (but there should have been a method
<code>isValidInteger(..)</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is<code>RuntimeException</code> an unchecked exception?</strong><br>
Yes, exactly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What should I do here?</strong><br>
It depends on where this code is and what you want to happen. If it is in the
UI layer - catch it and show a warning; if it's in the service layer - don't
catch it at all - let it bubble. Just don't swallow the exception. If an
exception occurs in most of the cases you should choose one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>log it and return</li>
<li>rethrow it (declare it to be thrown by the method)</li>
<li>construct a new exception by passing the current one in constructor </li>
<li>
<strong>Now, couldn't the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to recover the situation like this? Can I?</strong><br>
It could've been. But nothing stops you from catching the unchecked exception
as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why do people add class<code>Exception</code> in the throws clause?</strong><br>
Most often because people are lazy to consider what to catch and what to
rethrow. Throwing <code>Exception</code> is a bad practice and should be avoided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alas, there is no single rule to let you determine when to catch, when to
rethrow, when to use checked and when to use unchecked exceptions. I agree
this causes much confusion and a lot of bad code. The general principle is
stated by Bloch (you quoted a part of it). And the general principle is to
rethrow an exception to the layer where you can handle it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Whether something is a "checked exception" has nothing to do with whether you
catch it or what you do in the catch block. It's a property of exception
classes. Anything that is a subclass of <code>Exception</code> <em>except</em> for
<code>RuntimeException</code> and its subclasses is a checked exception.</p>
<p>The Java compiler forces you to either catch checked exceptions or declare
them in the method signature. It was supposed to improve program safety, but
the majority opinion seems to be that it's not worth the design problems it
creates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isnt handle error the sooner the
better? Why bubble up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because that's the entire <em>point</em> of exceptions. Without this possibility, you
would not need exceptions. They enable you to handle errors at a level you
choose, rather than forcing you to deal with them in low-level methods where
they originally occur.</p>

    <p>I was watching a Pluralsight course on React and the instructor stated that
props should not be changed. I'm now reading an article (uberVU/react-guide)
on props vs. state and it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both props and state changes trigger a render update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the article it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration, its options if
you may. They are received from above and immutable.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>So props can change but they should be immutable?</li>
<li>When should you use props and when should you use state? </li>
<li>If you have data that a React component needs, should it be passed through props or setup in the React component via <code>getInitialState</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Props and state are related. The state of one component will often become the
props of a child component. Props are passed to the child within the render
method of the parent as the second argument to <code>React.createElement()</code> or, if
you're using JSX, the more familiar tag attributes.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;MyChild name={this.state.childsName} /&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The parent's state value of <code>childsName</code> becomes the child's
<code>this.props.name</code>. From the child's perspective, the name prop is immutable.
If it needs to be changed, the parent should just change its internal state:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">setState</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">childsName</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'New name'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>and React will propagate it to the child for you. A natural follow-on question
is: what if the child needs to change its name prop? This is usually done
through child events and parent callbacks. The child might expose an event
called, for example, <code>onNameChanged</code>. The parent would then subscribe to the
event by passing a callback handler.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&lt;MyChild name={this.state.childsName} onNameChanged={this.handleName} /&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The child would pass its requested new name as an argument to the event
callback by calling, e.g., <code>this.props.onNameChanged('New name')</code>, and the
parent would use the name in the event handler to update its state.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">handleName</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">newName</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">{</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setState</span><span class="o">({</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">childsName</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">newName</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">});</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>For parent-child communication, simply pass props.</p>
<p>Use <strong>state</strong> to store the data your current page needs in your controller-
view.</p>
<p>Use <strong>props</strong> to pass data &amp; event handlers down to your child components.</p>
<p>These lists should help guide you when working with data in your components.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>are immutable <ul>
<li>which lets React do fast reference checks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>are used to pass data down from your view-controller <ul>
<li>your top level component</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>have better performance <ul>
<li>use this to pass data to child components</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>State</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>should be managed in your view-controller <ul>
<li>your top level component</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is mutable</li>
<li>has worse performance</li>
<li>should not be accessed from child components <ul>
<li>pass it down with props instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For communication between two components that don't have a parent-child
relationship, you can set up your own global event system. Subscribe to
events in componentDidMount(), unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount(), and
call setState() when you receive an event. Flux pattern is one of the
possible ways to arrange this. -

<p><strong>What Components Should Have State?</strong></p>
<p>Most of your components should simply take some data from props and render
it. However, sometimes you need to respond to user input, a server request
or the passage of time. For this you use state.</p>
<p>Try to keep as many of your components as possible <strong>stateless</strong>. By doing
this you'll isolate the state to its most logical place and minimize
redundancy, making it easier to reason about your application.</p>
<p>A common pattern is to create several <strong>stateless</strong> components that just
render data, and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that
passes its state to its children via props. The stateful component
encapsulates all of the interaction logic, while the stateless components
take care of rendering data in a declarative way. -
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-
uis.html#what-components-should-have-state</p>
<p><strong>What Should Go in State?</strong></p>
<p>State should contain data that a component's event handlers may change to
trigger a UI update. In real apps this data tends to be very small and JSON-
serializable. When building a stateful component, think about the minimal
possible representation of its state, and only store those properties in
this.state. Inside of render() simply compute any other information you need
based on this state. You'll find that thinking about and writing
applications in this way tends to lead to the most correct application,
since adding redundant or computed values to state means that you need to
explicitly keep them in sync rather than rely on React computing them for
you. - https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-
uis.html#what-should-go-in-state</p>
