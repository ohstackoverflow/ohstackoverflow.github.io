<p>What is the difference between Obfuscation, Hashing, and Encryption?<br>
Difference between encryption and hashing</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Well, you could look it up in Wikipedia... But since you want an explanation,
I'll do my best here:</p>
<h3>Hash Functions</h3>
<p>They provide a mapping between an arbitrary length input, and a (usually)
fixed length (or smaller length) output. It can be anything from a simple
crc32, to a full blown cryptographic hash function such as MD5 or
SHA1/2/256/512. The point is that there's a one-way mapping going on. It's
always a many:1 mapping (meaning there will always be collisions) since every
function produces a smaller output than it's capable of inputting (If you feed
every possible 1mb file into MD5, you'll get a ton of collisions).</p>
<p>The reason they are hard (or impossible in practicality) to reverse is because
of how they work internally. Most cryptographic hash functions iterate over
the input set many times to produce the output. So if we look at each fixed
length chunk of input (which is algorithm dependent), the hash function will
call that the current state. It will then iterate over the state and change it
to a new one and use that as feedback into itself (MD5 does this 64 times for
each 512bit chunk of data). It then somehow combines the resultant states from
all these iterations back together to form the resultant hash.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted to decode the hash, you'd first need to figure out how to
split the given hash into its iterated states (1 possibility for inputs
smaller than the size of a chunk of data, many for larger inputs). Then you'd
need to reverse the iteration for each state. Now, to explain why this is VERY
hard, imagine trying to deduce <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> from the following formula: <code>10 = a
+ b</code>. There are 10 positive combinations of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that can work. Now
loop over that a bunch of times: <code>tmp = a + b; a = b; b = tmp</code>. For 64
iterations, you'd have over 10^64 possibilities to try. And that's just a
simple addition where some state is preserved from iteration to iteration.
Real hash functions do a lot more than 1 operation (MD5 does about 15
operations on 4 state variables). And since the next iteration depends on the
state of the previous and the previous is destroyed in creating the current
state, it's all but impossible to determine the input state that led to a
given output state (for each iteration no less). Combine that, with the large
number of possibilities involved, and decoding even an MD5 will take a near
infinite (but not infinite) amount of resources. So many resources that it's
actually significantly cheaper to brute-force the hash if you have an idea of
the size of the input (for smaller inputs) than it is to even try to decode
the hash.</p>
<h3>Encryption Functions</h3>
<p>They provide a 1:1 mapping between an arbitrary length input and output. And
they are always reversible. The important thing to note is that it's
reversible using some method. And it's always 1:1 for a given key. Now, there
are multiple input:key pairs that might generate the same output (in fact
there usually are, depending on the encryption function). Good encrypted data
is indistinguishable from random noise. This is different from a good hash
output which is always of a consistent format.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>Use a hash function when you want to compare a value but can't store the plain
representation (for any number of reasons). Passwords should fit this use-case
very well since you don't want to store them plain-text for security reasons
(and shouldn't). But what if you wanted to check a filesystem for pirated
music files? It would be impractical to store 3 mb per music file. So instead,
take the hash of the file, and store that (md5 would store 16 bytes instead of
3mb). That way, you just hash each file and compare to the stored database of
hashes (This doesn't work as well in practice because of re-encoding, changing
file headers, etc, but it's an example use-case).</p>
<p>Use a hash function when you're checking validity of input data. That's what
they are designed for. If you have 2 pieces of input, and want to check to see
if they are the same, run both through a hash function. The probability of a
collision is astronomically low for small input sizes (assuming a good hash
function). That's why it's recommended for passwords. For passwords up to 32
characters, md5 has 4 times the output space. SHA1 has 6 times the output
space (approximately). SHA512 has about 16 times the output space. You don't
really care what the password <em>was</em> , you care if it's the same as the one
that was stored. That's why you should use hashes for passwords.</p>
<p>Use encryption whenever you need to get the input data back out. Notice the
word <strong>need</strong>. If you're storing credit card numbers, you need to get them
back out at some point, but don't want to store them plain text. So instead,
store the encrypted version and keep the key as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Hash functions are also great for signing data. For example, if you're using
HMAC, you sign a piece of data by taking a hash of the data concatenated with
a known but not transmitted value (a secret value). So, you send the plain-
text and the HMAC hash. Then, the receiver simply hashes the submitted data
with the known value and checks to see if it matches the transmitted HMAC. If
it's the same, you know it wasn't tampered with by a party without the secret
value. This is commonly used in secure cookie systems by HTTP frameworks, as
well as in message transmission of data over HTTP where you want some
assurance of integrity in the data.</p>
<h3>A note on hashes for passwords:</h3>
<p>A key feature of cryptographic hash functions is that they should be very fast
to create, and <strong>very</strong> difficult/slow to reverse (so much so that it's
practically impossible). This poses a problem with passwords. If you store
<code>sha512(password)</code>, you're not doing a thing to guard against rainbow tables
or brute force attacks. Remember, the hash function was designed for speed. So
it's trivial for an attacker to just run a dictionary through the hash
function and test each result.</p>
<p>Adding a salt helps matters since it adds a bit of unknown data to the hash.
So instead of finding anything that matches <code>md5(foo)</code>, they need to find
something that when added to the known salt produces <code>md5(foo.salt)</code> (which is
very much harder to do). But it still doesn't solve the speed problem since if
they know the salt it's just a matter of running the dictionary through.</p>
<p>So, there are ways of dealing with this. One popular method is called key
strengthening (or key stretching). Basically, you iterate over a hash many
times (thousands usually). This does two things. First, it slows down the
runtime of the hashing algorithm significantly. Second, if implemented right
(passing the input and salt back in on each iteration) actually increases the
entropy (available space) for the output, reducing the chances of collisions.
A trivial implementation is:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">password</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">salt</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5000</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sha512</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">password</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">salt</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>There are other, more standard implementations such as PBKDF2, BCrypt. But
this technique is used by quite a few security related systems (such as PGP,
WPA, Apache and OpenSSL).</p>
<p>The bottom line, <code>hash(password)</code> is not good enough. <code>hash(password + salt)</code>
is better, but still not good enough... Use a stretched hash mechanism to
produce your password hashes...</p>
<h3>Another note on trivial stretching</h3>
<p><strong>Do not under any circumstances feed the output of one hash directly back
into the hash function</strong> :</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sha512</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">password</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">salt</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">; </span>
<span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; i &lt; 1000; i++) {</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sha512</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">hash</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">; // &lt;-- Do NOT do this!</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>The reason for this has to do with collisions. Remember that all hash
functions have collisions because the possible output space (the number of
possible outputs) is smaller than then input space. To see why, let's look at
what happens. To preface this, let's make the assumption that there's a 0.001%
chance of collision from <code>sha1()</code> (it's <strong>much</strong> lower in reality, but for
demonstration purposes).</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">hash1 = sha1(password + salt);
</pre></div>

<p>Now, <code>hash1</code> has a probability of collision of 0.001%. But when we do the next
<code>hash2 = sha1(hash1);</code>, <strong>all collisions of<code>hash1</code> automatically become
collisions of <code>hash2</code></strong>. So now, we have hash1's rate at 0.001%, and the 2nd
<code>sha1()</code> call adds to that. So now, <code>hash2</code> has a probability of collision of
0.002%. That's twice as many chances! Each iteration will add another <code>0.001%</code>
chance of collision to the result. So, with 1000 iterations, the chance of
collision jumped from a trivial 0.001% to 1%. Now, the degradation is linear,
and the real probabilities are <strong>far</strong> smaller, but the effect is the same (an
estimation of the chance of a single collision with <code>md5</code> is about 1/(2128) or
1/(3x1038). While that seems small, thanks to the birthday attack it's not
really as small as it seems).</p>
<p>Instead, by re-appending the salt and password each time, you're re-
introducing data back into the hash function. So any collisions of any
particular round are no longer collisions of the next round. So:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sha512</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">password</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">salt</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
<span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; i &lt; 1000; i++) {</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">sha512</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">password</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">salt</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>Has the same chance of collision as the native <code>sha512</code> function. Which is
what you want. Use that instead.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>A hash function could be considered the same as baking a loaf of bread. You
start out with inputs (flour, water, yeast, etc...) and after applying the
hash function (mixing + baking), you end up with an output: a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>Going the other way is extraordinarily difficult - you can't really separate
the bread back into flour, water, yeast - some of that was lost during the
baking process, and you can never tell exactly how much water or flour or
yeast was used for a particular loaf, because that information was destroyed
by the hashing function (aka the oven).</p>
<p>Many different variants of inputs will theoretically produce identical loaves
(e.g. 2 cups of water and 1 tsbp of yeast produce exactly the same loaf as 2.1
cups of water and 0.9tsbp of yeast), but given one of those loaves, you can't
tell exactly what combo of inputs produced it.</p>
<p>Encryption, on the other hand, could be viewed as a safe deposit box. Whatever
you put in there comes back out, as long as you possess the key with which it
was locked up in the first place. It's a symmetric operation. Given a key and
some input, you get a certain output. Given that output, and the same key,
you'll get back the original input. It's a 1:1 mapping.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a reason why this method must be static?</strong></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The method is static because otherwise there would be ambiguity: which
constructor should be called? Especially if your class looks like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">public class JavaClass{
  protected JavaClass(int x){}
  public void main(String[] args){
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Should the JVM call <code>new JavaClass(int)</code>? What should it pass for <code>x</code>?</p>
<p>If not, should the JVM instantiate <code>JavaClass</code> without running any constructor
method? I think it shouldn't, because that will special-case your entire class
- sometimes you have an instance that hasn't been initialized, and you have to
check for it in every method that could be called.</p>
<p>There are just too many edge cases and ambiguities for it to make sense for
the JVM to have to instantiate a class before the entry point is called.
That's why <code>main</code> is static.</p>
<p>I have no idea why <code>main</code> is always marked <code>public</code> though.</p>

<p>Also it is recommend you not use the constructor method to initialize your
arrays. Instead, use the literal syntax:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">items</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">523</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3452</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">334</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5346</span><span class="p">];</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use the <code>~</code> operator if you are into terse JavaScript and want to
shorten the <code>-1</code> comparison:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nf">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">index</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3452</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="k">index</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">items</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1010</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Sometimes I even like to write a <code>contains</code> function to abstract this check
and make it easier to understand what's going on. What's awesome is this works
on arrays and strings both:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">contains</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">haystack</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">needle</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">!!~</span><span class="n">haystack</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">needle</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">can</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">be</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">used</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">like</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">so</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">contains</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3452</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">do</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">something</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Starting with ES6/ES2015 for strings, and proposed for ES2016 for arrays, you
can more easily determine if a source contains another value:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">haystack</span>.<span class="nv">includes</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">needle</span><span class="ss">))</span><span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">your</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">thing</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The <code>Array.indexOf()</code> method will replace the first instance. To get every
instance use <code>Array.map()</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span>.<span class="nv">map</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">function</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">item</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">item</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3452</span><span class="w"> </span>?<span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1010</span><span class="w"> </span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">item</span><span class="c1">; });</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, that creates a new array. If you want to do it in place, use
<code>Array.forEach()</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">forEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3452</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1010</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">}</span><span class="p">);</span>
