    <p>I have a question about the <em>beam search algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Let's say that <code>n = 2</code> (the number of nodes we are going to expand from every
node). So, at the beginning, we only have the root, with 2 nodes that we
expand from it. Now, from those two nodes, we expand two more. So, at the
moment, we have 4 leafs. We will continue like this till we find the answer.</p>
<p><em>Is this how beam search works? Does it expand only<code>n = 2</code> of every node, or
it keeps 2 leaf nodes at all the times?</em></p>
<p>I used to think that <code>n = 2</code> means that we should have 2 active nodes at most
from each node, not two for the whole tree.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In the "standard" <em>beam search</em> algorithm, at every step, the total number of
the nodes you currently "know about" is limited - and NOT the number of nodes
you will follow from each node.</p>
<p>Concretely, if <code>n = 2</code>, it means that the "beam" will be of size at most 2, at
all times. So, initially, you start from one node, then you discover all nodes
that are reachable from it, but discard all of them but two, and finish step 1
with 2 nodes. At step 2, you have two nodes, and you will expand both, and
discard all nodes again, except exactly 2 nodes (total, not from each!). In
the next steps, similarly, you will keep 2 nodes after each step.</p>
<p>Choosing which node to keep is usually done by some heuristic function that
evaluates which node is closest to the target.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>beam search algorithm</em> is not complete (i.e., it may not find a
solution if one exists) nor optimal (i.e. it may not find the best solution).
The best way to see this is witnessing that when <code>n = 1</code>, it basically reduces
to best-first-search.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="images/1A9Ed.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In beam search, instead of choosing the best token to generate at each
timestep, we keep k possible tokens at each step. This fixed-size memory
footprint k is called the beam width, on the metaphor of a flashlight beam
that can be parameterized to be wider or narrower.</p>
<p>Thus at the first step of decoding, we compute a softmax over the entire
vocabulary, assigning a probability to each word. We then select the k-best
options from this softmax output. These initial k outputs are the search
frontier and these k initial words are called hypotheses. A hypothesis is an
output sequence, a translation-so- far, together with its probability.</p>
<p>At subsequent steps, each of the k best hypotheses is extended incrementally
by being passed to distinct decoders, which each generate a softmax over the
entire vocabulary to extend the hypothesis to every possible next token.
Each of these k∗V hypotheses is scored by P(yi|x,y&lt;i): the product of the
probability of current word choice multiplied by the probability of the path
that led to it. We then prune the k∗V hypotheses down to the k best
hypotheses, so there are never more than k hypotheses at the frontier of the
search, and never more than k decoders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beam size(or beam width) is the k aforementioned.</p>

    <p>Can anyone explain to me in a easy and less mathematical way what is a
<code>Hessian</code> and how does it work in practice when optimizing the learning
process for a neural network ?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>To understand the <em>Hessian</em> you first need to understand <em>Jacobian</em> , and to
understand a <em>Jacobian</em> you need to understand the <em>derivative</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Derivative is the measure of how fast function value changes withe the change of the argument. So if you have the function f(x)=x^2 you can compute its derivative and obtain a knowledge how fast f(x+t) changes with small enough t. This gives you knowledge about basic <em>dynamics</em> of the function</li>
<li>Gradient shows you in multidimensional functions the direction of the biggest value change (which is based on the directional derivatives) so given a function ie. g(x,y)=-x+y^2 you will know, that it is better to minimize the value of x, while strongly maximize the vlaue of y. This is a base of gradient based methods, like <em>steepest descent</em> technique (used in the traditional backpropagation methods).</li>
<li>Jacobian is yet another generalization, as your function might have many values, like g(x,y)=(x+1, x <em>y, x-z), thus you now have 2</em> 3 partial derivatives, one gradient per each output value (each of 2 values) thus forming together a matrix of 2*3=6 values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, derivative shows you the dynamics of the function itself. But you can go
one step further, if you can use this dynamics to find the optimum of the
function, maybe you can do even better if you find out the <em>dynamics of this
dynamics</em> , and so - compute derivatives of second order? This is exactly what
<em>Hessian</em> is, it is a matrix of second order derivatives of your function. It
captures the dynamics of the derivatives, so how fast (in what direction) does
the change change. It may seem a bit complex at the first sight, but if you
think about it for a while it becomes quite clear. You want to go in the
direction of the gradient, but you do not know "how far" (what is the correct
step size). And so you define new, smaller optimization problem, where you are
asking "ok, I have this gradient, how can I tell where to go?" and solve it
analogously, using derivatives (and derivatives of the derivatives form the
Hessian).</p>
<p>You may also look at this in the geometrical way - gradient based optimization
approximates your function with the <strong>line</strong>. You simply try to find a line
which is closest to your function in a current point, and so it defines a
direction of change. Now, lines are quite primitive, maybe we could use some
more complex shapes like.... parabolas? Second derivative, hessian methods are
just trying to fit the parabola ( <strong>quadratic</strong> function, f(x)=ax^2+bx+c) to
your current position. And based on this approximation - chose the valid step.</p>

    <p>I am new to the field of AI and am reading about decision trees. I am
referring to the AIMA book which is pretty much the standard Intro to AI book
recommended. In the chapter on decision trees, they discuss in the book a case
wherein after the first attribute splits and there are no attributes left but
both positive and negative examples have still not been separated, it means
that these examples have exactly the same description.... The solution to this
case that they suggest is " <strong>to return the plurality classification of the
remaining examples</strong> ". I was wondering what that part in bold means? What
does it mean to return the 'plurality classification' of a set of examples?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>They would have said the majority class if there were only two classes.
Plurality is just the generalization of majority to more than 2 classes. It
just means take the most frequent class in that leaf and return that as your
prediction. For example, if you are classifying the colors of balls, and there
are 3 blue balls, 2 red balls, and 2 white balls in a leaf, return blue as
your prediction.</p>
