    <p>Suppose we are given data in a semi-structured format as a tree. As an
example, the tree can be formed as a valid XML document or as a valid JSON
document. You could imagine it being a lisp-like S-expression or an
(G)Algebraic Data Type in Haskell or Ocaml.</p>
<p>We are given a large number of "documents" in the tree structure. Our goal is
to cluster documents which are similar. By clustering, we mean a way to divide
the documents into <em>j</em> groups, such that elements in each looks like each
other.</p>
<p>I am sure there are papers out there which describes approaches but since I am
not very known in the area of AI/Clustering/MachineLearning, I want to ask
somebody who are what to look for and where to dig.</p>
<p>My current approach is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to convert each document into an N-dimensional vector set up for a K-means clustering.</li>
<li>To do this, I recursively walk the document tree and for each level I calculate a vector. If I am at a tree vertex, I recur on all subvertices and then sum their vectors. Also, whenever I recur, a power factor is applied so it does matter less and less the further down the tree I go. The documents final vector is the root of the tree.</li>
<li>Depending on the data at a tree leaf, I apply a function which takes the data into a vector.</li>
</ul>
<p>But surely, there are better approaches. One weakness of my approach is that
it will only similarity-cluster trees which has a top structure much like each
other. If the similarity is present, but occurs farther down the tree, then my
approach probably won't work very well.</p>
<p>I imagine there are solutions in full-text-search as well, but I do want to
take advantage of the semi-structure present in the data.</p>
<h3>Distance function</h3>
<p>As suggested, one need to define a distance function between documents.
Without this function, we can't apply a clustering algorithm.</p>
<p>In fact, it may be that the question is about that very distance function and
examples thereof. I want documents where elements near the root are the same
to cluster close to each other. The farther down the tree we go, the less it
matters.</p>
<h3>The take-one-step-back viewpoint:</h3>
<p>I want to cluster stack traces from programs. These are well-formed tree
structures, where the function close to the root are the inner function which
fails. I need a decent distance function between stack traces that probably
occur because the same event happened in code.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Given the nature of your problem (stack trace), I would reduce it to a string
matching problem. Representing a stack trace as a tree is a bit of overhead:
for each element in the stack trace, you have exactly one parent.</p>
<p>If string matching would indeed be more appropriate for your problem, you can
run through your data, map each node onto a hash and create for each
'document' its n-grams.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Mapping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exception A -&gt; 0</li>
<li>Exception B -&gt; 1</li>
<li>Exception C -&gt; 2</li>
<li>Exception D -&gt; 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Doc A: 0-1-2 Doc B: 1-2-3</p>
<p>2-grams for doc A: X0, 01, 12, 2X</p>
<p>2-grams for doc B: X1, 12, 23, 3X</p>
<p>Using the n-grams, you will be able to cluster similar sequences of events
regardless of the root node (in this examplem event 12)</p>
<p>However, if you are still convinced that you need trees, instead of strings,
you must consider the following: finding similarities for trees is a lot more
complex. You will want to find similar subtrees, with subtrees that are
similar over a greater depth resulting in a better similarity score. For this
purpose, you will need to discover closed subtrees (subtrees that are the base
subtrees for trees that extend it). What you don't want is a data collection
containing subtrees that are very rare, or that are present in each document
you are processing (which you will get if you do not look for frequent
patterns).</p>
<p>Here are some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1227182</li>
<li>http://www.springerlink.com/content/yu0bajqnn4cvh9w9/</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your frequent subtrees, you can use them in the same way as you
would use the n-grams for clustering.</p>

    <p>So I was assigned the problem of writing a 5x5x5 tic-tac-toe player using a
genetic algorithm. My approach was to start off with 3x3, get that working,
and then extend to 5x5, and then to 5x5x5.</p>
<p>The way it works is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simulate a whole bunch of games, and during each turn of each game, lookup in a corresponding table (X table or O table implemented as a c++ stdlib maps) for a response. If the board was not there, add the board to the table. Otherwise, make a random response. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I have complete tables, I initialize a bunch of players (each with a copy of the board table, initialized with random responses), and let them play against each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using their wins/losses to evaluate fitness, I keep a certain % of the best, and they move on. Rinse and repeat for X generations, and an optimal player should emerge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For 3x3, discounting boards that were reflections/rotations of other boards,
and boards where the move is either 'take the win' or 'block the win', the
total number of boards I would encounter were either 53 or 38, depending on
whether you go first or second. Fantastic! An optimal player was generated in
under an hour. Very cool!</p>
<p>Using the same strategy for 5x5, I knew the size of the table would increase,
but did not realize it would increase so drastically. Even discounting
rotations/reflections and mandatory moves, my table is ~3.6 million entries,
with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's clearly not going to work, I need a new plan. What if I don't
enumerate all the boards, but just <em>some</em> boards. Well, it seems like this
won't work either, because if each player has just a fraction of possible
boards they might see, then they are going to be making a lot of random moves,
clearly steering in the opposite direction of optimality.</p>
<p>What is a realistic way of going about this? Am I going to be stuck using
board features? The goal is to hard-code as little game functionality as
possible.</p>
<p>I've been doing research, but everything I read leads to min/max with A-B
pruning as the only viable option. I can certainly do it that way, but the GA
is really cool, my current method is just exceeding reality a bit here.</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em> Problem has been pretty much solved:</p>
<p>Using a similarity function that combines hamming distance of open spaces, the
possible win conditions, and a few other measures has brought the table down
to a very manageable 2500 possibilities, which a <code>std::map</code> handles in a
fraction of a second.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>My knowledge of GA is pretty limited, but in modeling board configurations,
aren't you asking the wrong question? Your task isn't to enumerate all the
possible winning configurations -- what you're trying to do is to find a
sequence of moves that leads to a winning configuration. Maybe the population
you should be looking at isn't a set of boards, but a set of move sequences.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I wasn't thinking so much of starting from a particular board as
starting from an empty board. It's obvious on a 3x3 board that move sequences
starting with (1,1) work out best for X. The important thing isn't that the
final board has an X in the middle, it's that the X was placed in the middle
<em>first</em>. If there's one or more best first moves for X, maybe there's also a
best second, third, or fourth move for X, too? After several rounds of fitness
testing and recombining, will we find that X's second move is usually the
same, or is one of a small set of values? And what about the third move?</p>
<p>This isn't minimax because you're not looking for the best moves one at a time
based on the previous state of the board, you're looking for all the best
moves at the same time, hoping to converge on a winning strategy.</p>
<p>I know this doesn't solve your problem, but if the idea is to evolve a winning
strategy then it seems natural that you'd want to look at sequences of moves
rather than board states.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>This seems to be a very old conversation but attracted my attention. Thinking
it might serve the public discussion, here is my input.</p>
<p>I think the aim in your assigned task needs to be defined more clearly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are you trying to find a set of winning boards? I don’t think so, because this is very straigtforward for a 3x3 board which can even be solved by hand, and it can be extrapolated to larger boards. GA could be utilized for larger boards, but it would only be a GA exercise. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you trying to utilize GA to train TicTacToe to AI players? I think this should be the case. In that case, your GA strings/chromosomes should not represent winning boards, but rather, they should represent ordered move sequences of players, for winning games. This is really a bit trickier to model though, as expected, and it would be a real AI training programming exercise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this perspective helps.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of Chess AI's around, and evidently some are good enough to
beat some of the world's greatest players.</p>
<p>I've heard that many attempts have been made to write successful AI's for the
board game Go, but so far nothing has been conceived beyond average amateur
level.</p>
<p>Could it be that the task of mathematically calculating the optimal move at
any given time in Go is an NP-complete problem?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Chess and Go are both EXPTIME complete. IIRC, Go has more possible moves, so I
think it a higher multiple of that complexity class than chess. Wikipedia has
a good article on the complexity of Go.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Even if Go is merely in <code>P</code> it could still be something horrendous like
<code>O(n^m)</code> where <code>n</code> is the number of spaces and <code>m</code> is some (large) fixed
number. Even being in <code>P</code> doesn't make something reasonable to compute.</p>
