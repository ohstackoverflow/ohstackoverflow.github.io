    <p>I was looking at what the guys in the Mario AI Competition have been doing and
some of them have built some pretty neat Mario bots utilizing the A* (A-Star)
Pathing Algorithm.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="images/U47gw.png"><br>
(Video of Mario A* Bot In Action)</p>
<p>My question is, how does A-Star compare with Dijkstra? Looking over them, they
seem similar.</p>
<p>Why would someone use one over the other? Especially in the context of pathing
in games?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Dijkstra is a special case for A* (when the heuristics is zero).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<h3>Dijkstra:</h3>
<p>It has one cost function, which is real cost value from source to each node:
<code>f(x)=g(x)</code>.<br>
It finds the shortest path from source to every other node by considering only
real cost.</p>
<h3>A* search:</h3>
<p>It has two cost function.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>g(x)</code>: same as Dijkstra. The real cost to reach a node <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>h(x)</code>: approximate cost from node <code>x</code> to goal node. It is a heuristic function. This heuristic function should never overestimate the cost. That means, the real cost to reach goal node from node <code>x</code> should be greater than or equal <code>h(x)</code>. It is called admissible heuristic.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total cost of each node is calculated by <code>f(x)=g(x)+h(x)</code></p>
<p>A* search only expands a node if it seems promising. It only focuses to reach
the goal node from the current node, not to reach every other nodes. It is
optimal, if the heuristic function is admissible.  </p>
<p>So if your heuristic function is good to approximate the future cost, than you
will need to explore a lot less nodes than Dijkstra.</p>

    <p>I found a lot of references to the AI of the ghosts in Pacman, but none of
them mentioned how the eyes find their way back to the central ghost hole
after a ghost is eaten by Pacman.</p>
<p>In my implementation I implemented a simple but awful solution. I just hard
coded on every corner which direction should be taken.</p>
<p>Are there any better/or the best solution? Maybe a generic one that works with
different level designs?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Actually, I'd say your approach is a pretty awesome solution, with almost
zero-run time cost compared to any sort of pathfinding.</p>
<p>If you need it to generalise to arbitrary maps, you could use any pathfinding
algorithm - breadth-first search is simple to implement, for example - and use
that to calculate which directions to encode at each of the corners, before
the game is run.</p>
<p>EDIT (11th August 2010): I was just referred to a very detailed page on the
Pacman system: The Pac-Man Dossier, and since I have the accepted answer here,
I felt I should update it. The article doesn't seem to cover the act of
returning to the monster house explicitly but it states that the direct
pathfinding in Pac-Man is a case of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue moving towards the next intersection (although this is essentially a special case of 'when given a choice, choose the direction that doesn't involve reversing your direction, as seen in the next step);</li>
<li>at the intersection, look at the adjacent exit squares, except the one you just came from;</li>
<li>picking one which is nearest the goal. If more than one is equally near the goal, pick the first valid direction in this order: up, left, down, right.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I've solved this problem for generic levels that way: Before the level starts,
I do some kind of "flood fill" from the monster hole; every tile of the maze
that isn't a wall gets a number that says how far it is away from the hole. So
when the eyes are on a tile with a distance of 68, they look which of the
neighbouring tiles has a distance of 67; that's the way to go then.</p>

    <p>I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving
them in any of the four directions to make "bigger" tiles. After each move, a
new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either <code>2</code> or <code>4</code>.
The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that
can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of <code>2048</code>.</p>
<p>One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought
of writing a program for it.</p>
<p>My current algorithm:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nv">game_over</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{

}
</pre></div>

<p>What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values <code>2</code>
and <code>4</code>, that is, I try to have <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> tiles, as minimum as possible. If
I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the
strategy seems good.</p>
<p>But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before
the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points
which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than
the above?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I developed a 2048 AI using <em>expectimax</em> optimization, instead of the minimax
search used by @ovolve's algorithm. The AI simply performs maximization over
all possible moves, followed by expectation over all possible tile spawns
(weighted by the probability of the tiles, i.e. 10% for a 4 and 90% for a 2).
As far as I'm aware, it is not possible to prune expectimax optimization
(except to remove branches that are exceedingly unlikely), and so the
algorithm used is a carefully optimized brute force search.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The AI in its default configuration (max search depth of 8) takes anywhere
from 10ms to 200ms to execute a move, depending on the complexity of the board
position. In testing, the AI achieves an average move rate of 5-10 moves per
second over the course of an entire game. If the search depth is limited to 6
moves, the AI can easily execute 20+ moves per second, which makes for some
interesting watching.</p>
<p>To assess the score performance of the AI, I ran the AI 100 times (connected
to the browser game via remote control). For each tile, here are the
proportions of games in which that tile was achieved at least once:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="mi">2048</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">%</span>
<span class="mi">4096</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">%</span>
<span class="mi">8192</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">%</span>
<span class="mi">16384</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">94</span><span class="o">%</span>
<span class="mi">32768</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">36</span><span class="o">%</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The minimum score over all runs was 124024; the maximum score achieved was
794076. The median score is 387222. The AI never failed to obtain the 2048
tile (so it never lost the game even once in 100 games); in fact, it achieved
the <strong>8192</strong> tile at least once in every run!</p>
<p>Here's the screenshot of the best run:</p>
<p><img alt="32768 tile, score 794076" src="images/jG2CL.png"></p>
<p>This game took 27830 moves over 96 minutes, or an average of 4.8 moves per
second.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>My approach encodes the entire board (16 entries) as a single 64-bit integer
(where tiles are the nybbles, i.e. 4-bit chunks). On a 64-bit machine, this
enables the entire board to be passed around in a single machine register.</p>
<p>Bit shift operations are used to extract individual rows and columns. A single
row or column is a 16-bit quantity, so a table of size 65536 can encode
transformations which operate on a single row or column. For example, moves
are implemented as 4 lookups into a precomputed "move effect table" which
describes how each move affects a single row or column (for example, the "move
right" table contains the entry "1122 -&gt; 0023" describing how the row
[2,2,4,4] becomes the row [0,0,4,8] when moved to the right).</p>
<p>Scoring is also done using table lookup. The tables contain heuristic scores
computed on all possible rows/columns, and the resultant score for a board is
simply the sum of the table values across each row and column.</p>
<p>This board representation, along with the table lookup approach for movement
and scoring, allows the AI to search a huge number of game states in a short
period of time (over 10,000,000 game states per second on one core of my
mid-2011 laptop).</p>
<p>The expectimax search itself is coded as a recursive search which alternates
between "expectation" steps (testing all possible tile spawn locations and
values, and weighting their optimized scores by the probability of each
possibility), and "maximization" steps (testing all possible moves and
selecting the one with the best score). The tree search terminates when it
sees a previously-seen position (using a transposition table), when it reaches
a predefined depth limit, or when it reaches a board state that is highly
unlikely (e.g. it was reached by getting 6 "4" tiles in a row from the
starting position). The typical search depth is 4-8 moves.</p>
<h3>Heuristics</h3>
<p>Several heuristics are used to direct the optimization algorithm towards
favorable positions. The precise choice of heuristic has a huge effect on the
performance of the algorithm. The various heuristics are weighted and combined
into a positional score, which determines how "good" a given board position
is. The optimization search will then aim to maximize the average score of all
possible board positions. The actual score, as shown by the game, is <em>not</em>
used to calculate the board score, since it is too heavily weighted in favor
of merging tiles (when delayed merging could produce a large benefit).</p>
<p>Initially, I used two very simple heuristics, granting "bonuses" for open
squares and for having large values on the edge. These heuristics performed
pretty well, frequently achieving 16384 but never getting to 32768.</p>
<p>Petr Morávek (@xificurk) took my AI and added two new heuristics. The first
heuristic was a penalty for having non-monotonic rows and columns which
increased as the ranks increased, ensuring that non-monotonic rows of small
numbers would not strongly affect the score, but non-monotonic rows of large
numbers hurt the score substantially. The second heuristic counted the number
of potential merges (adjacent equal values) in addition to open spaces. These
two heuristics served to push the algorithm towards monotonic boards (which
are easier to merge), and towards board positions with lots of merges
(encouraging it to align merges where possible for greater effect).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Petr also optimized the heuristic weights using a "meta-
optimization" strategy (using an algorithm called CMA-ES), where the weights
themselves were adjusted to obtain the highest possible average score.</p>
<p>The effect of these changes are extremely significant. The algorithm went from
achieving the 16384 tile around 13% of the time to achieving it over 90% of
the time, and the algorithm began to achieve 32768 over 1/3 of the time
(whereas the old heuristics never once produced a 32768 tile).</p>
<p>I believe there's still room for improvement on the heuristics. This algorithm
definitely isn't yet "optimal", but I feel like it's getting pretty close.</p>
<hr>
<p>That the AI achieves the 32768 tile in over a third of its games is a huge
milestone; I will be surprised to hear if any human players have achieved
32768 on the official game (i.e. without using tools like savestates or undo).
I think the 65536 tile is within reach!</p>
<p>You can try the AI for yourself. The code is available at
https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I'm the author of the AI program that others have mentioned in this thread.
You can view the AI in action or read the source.</p>
<p>Currently, the program achieves about a 90% win rate running in javascript in
the browser on my laptop given about 100 milliseconds of thinking time per
move, so while not perfect (yet!) it performs pretty well.</p>
<p>Since the game is a discrete state space, perfect information, turn-based game
like chess and checkers, I used the same methods that have been proven to work
on those games, namely minimax search with alpha-beta pruning. Since there is
already a lot of info on that algorithm out there, I'll just talk about the
two main heuristics that I use in the static evaluation function and which
formalize many of the intuitions that other people have expressed here.</p>
<h4>Monotonicity</h4>
<p>This heuristic tries to ensure that the values of the tiles are all either
increasing or decreasing along both the left/right and up/down directions.
This heuristic alone captures the intuition that many others have mentioned,
that higher valued tiles should be clustered in a corner. It will typically
prevent smaller valued tiles from getting orphaned and will keep the board
very organized, with smaller tiles cascading in and filling up into the larger
tiles.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of a perfectly monotonic grid. I obtained this by running
the algorithm with the eval function set to disregard the other heuristics and
only consider monotonicity.</p>
<p><img alt="A perfectly monotonic 2048 board" src="images/Oce4N.png"></p>
<h4>Smoothness</h4>
<p>The above heuristic alone tends to create structures in which adjacent tiles
are decreasing in value, but of course in order to merge, adjacent tiles need
to be the same value. Therefore, the smoothness heuristic just measures the
value difference between neighboring tiles, trying to minimize this count.</p>
<p>A commenter on Hacker News gave an interesting formalization of this idea in
terms of graph theory.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of a perfectly smooth grid.</p>
<p><img alt="A perfectly smooth 2048 board" src="images/wxgDV.png"></p>
<h4>Free Tiles</h4>
<p>And finally, there is a penalty for having too few free tiles, since options
can quickly run out when the game board gets too cramped.</p>
<p>And that's it! Searching through the game space while optimizing these
criteria yields remarkably good performance. One advantage to using a
generalized approach like this rather than an explicitly coded move strategy
is that the algorithm can often find interesting and unexpected solutions. If
you watch it run, it will often make surprising but effective moves, like
suddenly switching which wall or corner it's building up against.</p>
<h3><em>Edit:</em></h3>
<p>Here's a demonstration of the power of this approach. I uncapped the tile
values (so it kept going after reaching 2048) and here is the best result
after eight trials.</p>
<p><img alt="4096" src="images/x69jZ.png"></p>
<p>Yes, that's a 4096 alongside a 2048. =) That means it achieved the elusive
2048 tile three times on the same board.</p>
