<p>What do <code>real</code>, <code>user</code> and <code>sys</code> mean in the output of time? Which one is
meaningful when benchmarking my app?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Real, User and Sys process time statistics</strong></p>
<p>One of these things is not like the other. Real refers to actual elapsed time;
User and Sys refer to CPU time used <em>only by the process.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real</strong> is wall clock time - time from start to finish of the call. This is all elapsed time including time slices used by other processes and time the process spends blocked (for example if it is waiting for I/O to complete).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User</strong> is the amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) <em>within</em> the process. This is only actual CPU time used in executing the process. Other processes and time the process spends blocked do not count towards this figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sys</strong> is the amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process. This means executing CPU time spent in system calls <em>within the kernel,</em> as opposed to library code, which is still running in user-space. Like 'user', this is only CPU time used by the process. See below for a brief description of kernel mode (also known as 'supervisor' mode) and the system call mechanism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>User+Sys</code> will tell you how much actual CPU time your process used. Note that
this is across all CPUs, so if the process has multiple threads (and this
process is running on a computer with more than one processor) it could
potentially exceed the wall clock time reported by <code>Real</code> (which usually
occurs). Note that in the output these figures include the <code>User</code> and <code>Sys</code>
time of all child processes (and their descendants) as well when they could
have been collected, e.g. by <code>wait(2)</code> or <code>waitpid(2)</code>, although the
underlying system calls return the statistics for the process and its children
separately.</p>
<p><strong>Origins of the statistics reported by<code>time (1)</code></strong></p>
<p>The statistics reported by <code>time</code> are gathered from various system calls.
'User' and 'Sys' come from <code>wait (2)</code> (POSIX) or <code>times (2)</code> (POSIX),
depending on the particular system. 'Real' is calculated from a start and end
time gathered from the <code>gettimeofday (2)</code> call. Depending on the version of
the system, various other statistics such as the number of context switches
may also be gathered by <code>time</code>.</p>
<p>On a multi-processor machine, a multi-threaded process or a process forking
children could have an elapsed time smaller than the total CPU time - as
different threads or processes may run in parallel. Also, the time statistics
reported come from different origins, so times recorded for very short running
tasks may be subject to rounding errors, as the example given by the original
poster shows.</p>
<p><strong>A brief primer on Kernel vs. User mode</strong></p>
<p>On Unix, or any protected-memory operating system, 'Kernel' or 'Supervisor'
mode refers to a privileged mode that the CPU can operate in. Certain
privileged actions that could affect security or stability can only be done
when the CPU is operating in this mode; these actions are not available to
application code. An example of such an action might be manipulation of the
MMU to gain access to the address space of another process. Normally, user-
mode code cannot do this (with good reason), although it can request shared
memory from the kernel, which <em>could</em> be read or written by more than one
process. In this case, the shared memory is explicitly requested from the
kernel through a secure mechanism and both processes have to explicitly attach
to it in order to use it.</p>
<p>The privileged mode is usually referred to as 'kernel' mode because the kernel
is executed by the CPU running in this mode. In order to switch to kernel mode
you have to issue a specific instruction (often called a <em>trap</em> ) that
switches the CPU to running in kernel mode <em>and runs code from a specific
location held in a jump table.</em> For security reasons, you cannot switch to
kernel mode and execute arbitrary code - the traps are managed through a table
of addresses that cannot be written to unless the CPU is running in supervisor
mode. You trap with an explicit trap number and the address is looked up in
the jump table; the kernel has a finite number of controlled entry points.</p>
<p>The 'system' calls in the C library (particularly those described in Section 2
of the man pages) have a user-mode component, which is what you actually call
from your C program. Behind the scenes, they may issue one or more system
calls to the kernel to do specific services such as I/O, but they still also
have code running in user-mode. It is also quite possible to directly issue a
trap to kernel mode from any user space code if desired, although you may need
to write a snippet of assembly language to set up the registers correctly for
the call.</p>
<p><strong>More about 'sys'</strong></p>
<p>There are things that your code cannot do from user mode - things like
allocating memory or accessing hardware (HDD, network, etc.). These are under
the supervision of the kernel, and it alone can do them. Some operations like
<code>malloc</code> or<code>fread</code>/<code>fwrite</code> will invoke these kernel functions and that then
will count as 'sys' time. Unfortunately it's not as simple as "every call to
malloc will be counted in 'sys' time". The call to <code>malloc</code> will do some
processing of its own (still counted in 'user' time) and then somewhere along
the way it may call the function in kernel (counted in 'sys' time). After
returning from the kernel call, there will be some more time in 'user' and
then <code>malloc</code> will return to your code. As for when the switch happens, and
how much of it is spent in kernel mode... you cannot say. It depends on the
implementation of the library. Also, other seemingly innocent functions might
also use <code>malloc</code> and the like in the background, which will again have some
time in 'sys' then.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>To expand on the accepted answer, I just wanted to provide another reason why
<code>real</code> ≠ <code>user</code> + <code>sys</code>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <code>real</code> represents actual elapsed time, while <code>user</code> and
<code>sys</code> values represent CPU execution time. As a result, on a multicore system,
the <code>user</code> and/or <code>sys</code> time (as well as their sum) can actually <em>exceed</em> the
real time. For example, on a Java app I'm running for class I get this set of
values:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">real    1m47.363s
user    2m41.318s
sys     0m4.013s

<p>(It seems that pull fetches all branches from all remotes, but I always fetch
first just to be sure.)</p>
<p>Run the first command only if there are remote branches on the server that
aren't tracked by your local branches.</p>
<h4>Complete answer</h4>
<p>You can fetch all branches from all remotes like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git fetch --all
</pre></div>

<p>It's basically a power move.</p>
<p><code>fetch</code> updates local copies of remote branches so this is always safe for
your local branches <strong>BUT</strong> :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>fetch</code> will not <strong>update</strong> local branches (which <strong>track</strong> remote branches); if you want to update your local branches you still need to pull every branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fetch</code> will not <strong>create</strong> local branches (which <strong>track</strong> remote branches), you have to do this manually. If you want to list all remote branches: <code>git branch -a</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To <strong>update</strong> local branches which track remote branches:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git pull --all
</pre></div>

<p>However, this can be still insufficient. It will work only for your local
branches which track remote branches. To track all remote branches execute
this oneliner <strong>BEFORE</strong> <code>git pull --all</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span>-r<span class="w"> </span>|<span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span>-v<span class="w"> </span>'\-&gt;'<span class="w"> </span>|<span class="w"> </span>sed<span class="w"> </span>"s,\x1B\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z],,g"<span class="w"> </span>|<span class="w"> </span>while<span class="w"> </span>read<span class="w"> </span>remote;<span class="w"> </span>do<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span>--track<span class="w"> </span>"<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">remote</span><span class="c1">#origin/</span><span class="cp">}</span>"<span class="w"> </span>"<span class="nv">$remote</span>";<span class="w"> </span>done
</pre></div>

<p>P.S. AFAIK <code>git fetch --all</code> and <code>git remote update</code> are equivalent.</p>

<p>Kamil Szot's comment, which folks have found useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had to use:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">for<span class="w"> </span>remote<span class="w"> </span>in<span class="w"> </span>`git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span>-r`;<span class="w"> </span>do<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span>--track<span class="w"> </span><span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">remote</span><span class="c1">#origin/</span><span class="cp">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>$remote; done</p>
<p>because your code created local branches named <code>origin/branchname</code> and I was
getting "refname 'origin/branchname' is ambiguous whenever I referred to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>To list remote branches:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git branch -r

<p>To checkout a remote branch as a local branch:</p>

    <p>I have changes to a file, plus a new file, and would like to use git stash to
put them away while I switch to another task. But git stash by itself stashes
only the changes to the existing file; the new file remains in my working
tree, cluttering up my future work. How do I stash this untracked file?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>To stash your working directory including untracked files (especially those
that are in the <code>.gitignore</code>) then you probably want to use this cmd:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">git</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">stash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="k">include</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">untracked</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the shorthand <code>-u</code> instead of <code>--include-
untracked</code>, or simply <code>git stash --all</code> which stashes all files, including
<strong>untracked</strong> and <strong>ignored</strong> files. This bahaviour changed in 2018, so make
sure your git is up to date.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Warning: there seems to be (or have been) situations in which contents of
ignored directories could be deleted permanently. See this archived website
for more information</strong>.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>As of git 1.7.7, <code>git stash</code> accepts the <code>--include-untracked</code> option (or
short-hand <code>-u</code>). To include untracked files in your stash, use either of the
following commands:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">git</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">stash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="k">include</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">untracked</span>
#<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">or</span>
<span class="nv">git</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">stash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">u</span>
</pre></div>

<p>__Warning, doing this will permanently delete your files if you have any
directory/<em> entries in your gitignore file.</em>*</p>
