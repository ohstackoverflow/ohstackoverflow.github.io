    <p>I know it might sound strange but I would like to know one thing in this new
world where Microsoft Visual F# is getting into. There are many application of
this language, I am going to learn, regarding parsing, functional programming,
structured programming... But what about artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Are there any applications for Fuzzy Logic? Is F# a good language to be used
for Fuzzy Logic applications?</p>
<p>At university we are studying Prolog and similar languages. Prolog is able to
create complex query in a very plain and short expresisons (by taking
advantage of predicates and facts). Is F# able to do this?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Fuzzy Logic.</strong> F# doesn't provide any types for implementing fuzzy logic
calculations out of the box, but it is certainly possible to use F# in this
domain. The succinctness of F# and the ability to define custom overloaded
operators should make code based on fuzzy logic quite nice. I did a quick
search and discovered a few articles implementing fuzzy logic in F#:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy Logic in F#, Example 1 </li>
<li>FuzzyAdvisor - A Simple Fuzzy Logic Expert System in F#</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prolog</strong> is a bit different question. The power (and also the weakness) of
Prolog come from the fact that it has backtracking built directly in the
language. This makes it very nice for implementing search algorithms based on
backtracking, but it also a limitation.</p>
<p>F# doesn't have any direct support for backtracking, but it is quite easy to
write algorithms based on backtracking using <em>recursion</em> (which is the main
control flow mechanism in both F# and Prolog).</p>
<p>Also, it is possible to implement <em>domain specific language</em> for logical
programming in F#. This means that you'd implement something like Prolog
within F# and then write your search algorithms using this mini-language in F#
(possibly using other F# features as needed). You can find more information
about similar problems in this question.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>F# is a general purpose language with some nice language features, such as
computation expression/Monad and quotation. You can assume that it has about
the same power as C#.</p>
<p>It is not like Matlab or R, where a lot of pre-implemented libraries are
built-in. If you want to implement a Fuzzy Logic library or other AI
algorithms from scratch, F# is a very good language for you as its language
features make life easier.</p>
<p>But if you just want to use a Fuzzy logic library, then using other languages
or specialized systems will be more appropriate because F# or .Net in general
does not have very good quality libraries in this aspect.</p>

    <p>I have a degree in computer science and I have taken the following math

<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Probability</li>

<p>What other courses should I take in order to prepare for studying wavelets,

<p>Looks like this was closed for not being "programming related". That is wrong!</p>
<p>Wavelet transform is a very common image processing technique, it's used in
H.264 and JPEG2000. Is image processing beyond the scope of StackOverflow?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>On top of what you've got there already, I would recommend signal processing
or some similar course that covers Fourier transforms and the like. Besides
being useful as a foundation for wavelets, Fourier theory will give you a new
way of looking at data that is often useful. Wavelets will probably be part of
the curriculum for more advanced signal processing courses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Linear algebra and calculus may help you there, but not much else. You'll also
want to look at complex analysis and differential equations.</p>

    <p>For my university project I am creating a neural network that can classify the
likelihood that a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. I am training
with backpropagation. I am writing this in Java. I would like to apply
multithreading, because my computer is a quad-core i7. It bugs me to spend
hours training and see most of my cores idle.</p>
<p>But how would I apply multithreading to backpropagation? Backprop works by
adjusting the errors backwards through the network. One layer must be done
before the other can continue. Is there any way that I can modify my program
to do multicore backdrop?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>First of all don't use backpropagation. There are many other options out
there. I would suggest trying RPROP (resilient propagation). It won't be that
big of modification to your backpropagation algorithm. You do not need to
specify learning rate or momentum. Its really almost as if you have an
individual, variable, learning rate for every connection in the neural
network.</p>
<p>As to applying multithreading to backpropagation. I just wrote an article on
this topic.</p>
<p>http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/mprop/compare.html</p>
<p>Basically I create a number of threads and divide up the training data so each
thread has a near equal amount. I am calculating the gradients in each thread
and they are summed in a reduce step. How the gradients are applied to the
weights depends on the propagation training algorithm used, but the weight
update is done in a critical section.</p>
<p>When you have considerably more training samples than weights the code spends
much more time in the multi-threaded gradient calculation than the critical
section weight update.</p>
<p>I provide some of the performance results at the above link. It does really
speed things up!</p>
