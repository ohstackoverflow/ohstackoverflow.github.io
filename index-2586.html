    <p>Should files be named something-with-hyphens.js, camelCased.js, or something
else?</p>
<p>I didn't find the answer to this question here.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>One possible naming convention is to use something similar to the naming
scheme jQuery uses. It's not universally adopted but it is pretty common.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">product-name.plugin-ver.sion.filetype.js
</pre></div>

<p>where the <code>product-name</code> + <code>plugin</code> pair can also represent a <em>namespace</em> and
a <em>module</em>. The <code>version</code> and <code>filetype</code> are usually optional.</p>
<p><code>filetype</code> can be something relative to how the content of the file is. Often
seen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>min</code> for minified files</li>
<li>
<code>custom</code> for custom built or modified files</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jquery-1.4.2.min.js</code></li>
<li><code>jquery.plugin-0.1.js</code></li>
<li><code>myapp.invoice.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<p>I'm not aware of any particular convention for javascript files as they aren't
really unique on the web versus css files or html files or any other type of
file like that. There are some "safe" things you can do that make it less
likely you will accidentally run into a cross platform issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Use all lowercase filenames.</strong> There are some operating systems that are not case sensitive for filenames and using all lowercase prevents inadvertently using two files that differ only in case that might not work on some operating systems.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't use spaces in the filename.</strong> While this technically can be made to work there are lots of reasons why spaces in filenames can lead to problems. </li>
<li>
<strong>A hyphen is OK for a word separator.</strong> If you want to use some sort of separator for multiple words instead of a space or camelcase as in <code>various-scripts.js</code>, a hyphen is a safe and useful and commonly used separator.</li>
<li>
<strong>Think about using version numbers in your filenames.</strong> When you want to upgrade your scripts, plan for the effects of browser or CDN caching. The simplest way to use long term caching (for speed and efficiency), but immediate and safe upgrades when you upgrade a JS file is to include a version number in the deployed filename or path (like jQuery does with jquery-1.6.2.js) and then you bump/change that version number whenever you upgrade/change the file. This will guarantee that no page that requests the newer version is ever served the older version from a cache.</li>
</ol>

    <p>After answering a question about how to force-free objects in Java (the guy
was clearing a 1.5GB HashMap) with <code>System.gc()</code>, I was told it's bad practice
to call <code>System.gc()</code> manually, but the comments were not entirely convincing.
In addition, no one seemed to dare to upvote, nor downvote my answer.</p>
<p>I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage
collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could
also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss.</p>
<p>I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to
reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data
is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a
few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you <em>know</em> there's like 1.5 GB
of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is
<code>System.gc()</code> systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes
okay?</p>
<p>So the question is actually double:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is or isn't it bad practice to call <code>System.gc()</code>? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle? Are there really garbage collector implementations that can do their work without stopping the world? Please shed some light over the various assertions people have made in the comments to my answer.</li>
<li>Where's the threshold? Is it <em>never</em> a good idea to call <code>System.gc()</code>, or are there times when it's acceptable? If so, what are those times?</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The reason everyone always says to avoid <code>System.gc()</code> is that it is a <em>pretty
good indicator of fundamentally broken code</em>. Any code that depends on it for
correctness is certainly broken; any that rely on it for performance are most
likely broken.</p>
<p>You don't know what sort of garbage collector you are running under. There are
certainly some that do not <em>"stop the world"</em> as you assert, but some JVMs
aren't that smart or for various reasons (perhaps they are on a phone?) don't
do it. You don't know what it's going to do.</p>
<p>Also, it's not guaranteed to do anything. The JVM may just entirely ignore
your request.</p>
<p>The combination of "you don't know what it will do," "you don't know if it
will even help," and "you shouldn't need to call it anyway" are why people are
so forceful in saying that generally you shouldn't call it. I think it's a
case of "if you need to ask whether you should be using this, you shouldn't"</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to address a few concerns from the other thread:</p>
<p>After reading the thread you linked, there's a few more things I'd like to
point out. First, someone suggested that calling <code>gc()</code> may return memory to
the system. That's certainly not necessarily true - the Java heap itself grows
independently of Java allocations.</p>
<p>As in, the JVM will hold memory (many tens of megabytes) and grow the heap as
necessary. It doesn't necessarily return that memory to the system even when
you free Java objects; it is perfectly free to hold on to the allocated memory
to use for future Java allocations.</p>
<p>To show that it's possible that <code>System.gc()</code> does nothing, view JDK bug
6668279 and in particular that there's a <code>-XX:DisableExplicitGC</code> VM option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default calls to <code>System.gc()</code> are enabled (<code>-XX:-DisableExplicitGC</code>).
Use <code>-XX:+DisableExplicitGC</code> to disable calls to <code>System.gc()</code>. Note that
the JVM still performs garbage collection when necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>It has already been explained that calling <code>system.gc()</code> <em>may</em> do nothing, and
that any code that "needs" the garbage collector to run is broken.</p>
<p>However, the pragmatic reason that it is bad practice to call <code>System.gc()</code> is
that it is inefficient. And in the worst case, it is <strong>horribly inefficient</strong>!
Let me explain.</p>
<p>A typical GC algorithm identifies garbage by traversing all non-garbage
objects in the heap, and inferring that any object not visited must be
garbage. From this, we can model the total work of a garbage collection
consists of one part that is proportional to the amount of live data, and
another part that is proportional to the amount of garbage; i.e. <code>work = (live
* W1 + garbage * W2)</code>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that you do the following in a single-threaded application.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">System.gc(); System.gc();
</pre></div>

<p>The first call will (we predict) do <code>(live * W1 + garbage * W2)</code> work, and get
rid of the outstanding garbage.</p>
<p>The second call will do <code>(live* W1 + 0 * W2)</code> work and reclaim nothing. In
other words we have done <code>(live * W1)</code> work and <em>achieved absolutely nothing</em>.</p>
<p>We can model the efficiency of the collector as the amount of work needed to
collect a unit of garbage; i.e. <code>efficiency = (live * W1 + garbage * W2) /
garbage</code>. So to make the GC as efficient as possible, we need to <em>maximize</em>
the value of <code>garbage</code> when we run the GC; i.e. wait until the heap is full.
(And also, make the heap as big as possible. But that is a separate topic.)</p>
<p>If the application does not interfere (by calling <code>System.gc()</code>), the GC will
wait until the heap is full before running, resulting in efficient collection
of garbage1. But if the application forces the GC to run, the chances are that
the heap won't be full, and the result will be that garbage is collected
inefficiently. And the more often the application forces GC, the more
inefficient the GC becomes.</p>
<p>Note: the above explanation glosses over the fact that a typical modern GC
partitions the heap into "spaces", the GC may dynamically expand the heap, the
application's working set of non-garbage objects may vary and so on. Even so,
the same basic principal applies across the board to all true garbage
collectors2. It is inefficient to force the GC to run.</p>
<hr>
<p>1 - This is how the "throughput" collector works. Concurrent collectors such
as CMS and G1 use different criteria to decide when to start the garbage
collector.</p>
<p>2 - I'm also excluding memory managers that use reference counting
exclusively, but no current Java implementation uses that approach ... for
good reason.</p>

SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE MyColumn IS NOT NULL (568 Results)
</pre></div>

<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> is Standard SQL-92; <code>!=</code> is its equivalent. Both evaluate for values,
which <code>NULL</code> is not -- <code>NULL</code> is a placeholder to say there is the absence of
a value.</p>
<p>Which is why you can only use <code>IS NULL</code>/<code>IS NOT NULL</code> as predicates for such
situations.</p>
<p>This behavior is not specific to SQL Server. All standards-compliant SQL
dialects work the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : To compare if your <strong>value is not null</strong> , you use <code>IS NOT NULL</code>,
while to compare with <strong>not null</strong> value, you use <code>&lt;&gt; 'YOUR_VALUE'</code>. I can't
say if my value equals or not equals to NULL, but I can say if my value is
NULL or NOT NULL. I can compare if my value is something other than NULL.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>NULL has no value, and so cannot be compared using the scalar value operators.</p>
<p>In other words, no value can ever be equal to (or not equal to) NULL because
NULL has no value.</p>
<p>Hence, SQL has special IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates for dealing with
NULL.</p>
