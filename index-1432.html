    <p>I am attempting to create a "behavior tree" using C#.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, a behavior tree is basically a framework that you
can construct an AI around. There are Sequencers, Selectors, Decorators,
composite actions, and other things.</p>
<p>I have found a single library that has implimented a "behavior tree" in C#,
located here (http://code.google.com/p/treesharp/) but I cannot understand how
to actually use it since there is no example code I can draw from. Could
anyone here perhaps make some simple example code that shows how to actually
use this framework.. or perhaps you know of another way to impliment a
behavior tree in C#?</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I just looked at that implementation and I find myself wondering why so much
code is needed for something relatively simple.</p>
<p>From what you say, you want a simple way of composing behaviours. A behaviour
here, I presume, is a mapping from a state to zero or more actions by an
agent. You can model this very easily using C# lambdas. For example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Selector</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">Func</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">bool</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">cond</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ifTrue</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ifFalse</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">cond</span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">then</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ifTrue</span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ifFalse</span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span>}<span class="c1">;</span>
}

<span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Sequencer</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">b</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="c1">; b(); }</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>The leaves of your tree are simple Actions that do something appropriate to
the state. You "run" a tree simply by executing it.</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy, you can parameterise this scheme to make the state
explicit.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>---- Addendum ----</p>
<p>Jason asked for an example of how you could use this approach, so here's a
simple "AI" patrolling guard example (I assume WorldState corresponds to a
description of the environment at the time the behaviour tree is evaluated):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">Func</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nv">bool</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">ifPlayerIsInSight</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>...<span class="nv">true</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">iff</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">WorldState</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">shows</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">guard</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">can</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">see</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">player</span>...<span class="c1">;</span>

<span class="nv">Action</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">shootAtPlayer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span>...<span class="nv">aim</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">guard</span><span class="err">'s weapon at player and fire... };</span>

<span class="err">Func&lt;bool&gt; ifUnderFire = () =&gt; ...true iff WorldState shows guard hears player gunfire...;</span>

<span class="err">Action takeCover = () =&gt; { ...guard runs for nearest shelter... };</span>

<span class="err">Action walkBackAndForthGuardingDoorway = () =&gt; { ...default guard patrol behaviour... };</span>

<span class="err">Action patrollingGuardBehaviour =</span>
<span class="err">  Selector(ifPlayerIsInSight, shootAtPlayer,</span>
<span class="err">    Selector(ifUnderFire, takeCover,</span>
<span class="err">      walkBackAndForthGuardingDoorway));</span>
</pre></div>

<p>To make the guard do something, just call <code>patrollingGuardBehaviour()</code>. Note
that the various subactions and tests can be implemented as methods with the
right signatures rather than inline as lambdas. You can add other combinators
to <code>Selector</code> and <code>Sequencer</code>, e.g., for parallel activity.</p>

<p>It looks like one of the devs behind TreeSharp, apocdev, has some code that
uses TreeSharp for some kind of spell-casting World of Warcraft player.</p>
<p>Here's a snippit:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Composite</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">CreateSpellCheckAndCast</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="ss">)</span>
{
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Decorator</span><span class="ss">(</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">ret</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Spells</span>.<span class="nv">CanCast</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="ss">)</span>,
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nv">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Action</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">ret</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Spells</span>.<span class="nv">Cast</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="ss">)))</span><span class="c1">;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>I'm not certain, but the usage here seems pretty simple: the <code>Decorator</code> class
looks like it checks a predicate (<code>Spells.CanCast</code>) before trying to execute
some action (<code>Spells.Cast</code>).</p>
<p>So a <code>Composite</code> is perhaps an <code>Action</code> that can do several things, e.g. check
a predicate beforehand or execute several actions in sequence.</p>
<p>apocdev's blog mentions this overview of behavior trees, which links to more
general descriptions of sequences, selectors, and decorators.</p>

    <p>It's really all in the title, but here's a breakdown for anyone who is
interested in Evolutionary Algorithms:</p>
<p>In an EA, the basic premise is that you randomly generate a certain number of
organisms (which are really just sets of parameters), run them against a
problem, and then let the top performers survive.</p>
<p>You then repopulate with a combination of crossbreeds of the survivors,
mutations of the survivors, and also a certain number of new random organisms.</p>
<p>Do that several thousand times, and efficient organisms arise.</p>
<p>Some people also do things like introduce multiple "islands" of organisms,
which are seperate populations that are allowed to crossbreed once in awhile.</p>
<p>So, my question is: what are the optimal repopulation percentages?</p>
<p>I have been keeping the top 10% performers, and repopulating with 30%
crossbreeds and 30% mutations. The remaining 30% is for new organisms.</p>
<p>I have also tried out the multiple island theory, and I'm interested in your
results on that as well.</p>
<p>It is not lost on me that this is exactly the type of problem an EA could
solve. Are you aware of anyone trying that?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I initially tried to model what I thought organic systems were like.
Ultimately decided that was no good, and went more aggressive, with 10% kept,
20% mutated, 60% crossbred, and 10% random.</p>
<p>Then I noticed my top 10% were all roughly identical. So I increased the
random to 30%. That helped some, but not much.</p>
<p>I did try multiple island, and generation-skipping, and reseeding, which gave
better results, but still highly unsatisfactory, very little variation in the
top 10%, crazy-long numbers of generations to get any results. Mostly the code
learned how to hack my fitness evaluation.</p>
<p>It's really easy to get top performers, so don't worry about keeping too many
of them around. Crossbreeds help to pare down positive and negative traits, so
they're useful, but really what you want to get is a lot of good random bred
in. Focus on mutations and new randoms to bring in features, and let the
crossbreeds and top performers just keep track of the best and refine them
more slowly. IE: stuff based on the last generation is just finding a better
local maxima, randoms find better global maxima.</p>
<p>I still believe optimal answers to your question can be found by observing
natural phenomena, such as in a recent article regarding randomness of fruit-
fly flight paths, so that may pan out.</p>
<p>Probably the best answer is to just run it and tweak it, don't be afraid to
tweak it pretty heavily, the populations are robust. Make sure you implement a
way to save and continue.</p>

    <p>I'm having trouble seeing what the threshold actually does in a single-layer
perceptron. The data is usually separated no matter what the value of the
threshold is. It seems a lower threshold divides the data more equally; is
this what it is used for?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Actually, you'll just set threshold when you aren't using bias. Otherwise, the
threshold is 0.</p>
<p>Remember that, a single neuron divides your input space with a hyperplane. Ok?</p>
<p>Now imagine a neuron with 2 inputs <code>X=[x1, x2]</code>, 2 weights <code>W=[w1, w2]</code> and
threshold <code>TH</code>. The equation shows how this neuron works:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">x1.w1 + x2.w2 = TH
</pre></div>

<p>this is equals to:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">x1.w1 + x2.w2 - 1.TH = 0
</pre></div>

<p>I.e., this is your hyperplane equation that will divides the input space.</p>
<p>Notice that, this neuron just work if you set manually the threshold. The
solution is change TH to another weight, so:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">x1.w1 + x2.w2 - 1.w0 = 0
</pre></div>

<p>Where the term <code>1.w0</code> is your BIAS. Now you still can draw a plane in your
input space without set manually a threshold (i.e, threshold is always 0).
But, in case you set the threshold to another value, the weights will just
adapt themselves to adjust equation, i.e., weights ( <strong>INCLUDING BIAS</strong> )
absorves the threshold effects.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated in each
node, and if the value is above some threshold (typically 0) the neuron fires
and takes the activated value (typically 1); otherwise it takes the
deactivated value (typically -1). Neurons with this kind of activation
function are also called Artificial neurons or linear threshold units.</p>
