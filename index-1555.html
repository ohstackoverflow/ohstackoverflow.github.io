    <p>I want to understand the difference between a branch, a fork and a clone in
Git?</p>
<p>Similarly, what does it mean when I do a <code>git fetch</code> as opposed to a <code>git
pull</code>?</p>
<p>Also, what does <code>rebase</code> mean in comparison to <code>merge</code>?</p>
<p>How can I squash individual commits themselves together?</p>
<p>How are they used, why are they used and what do they represent?</p>
<p>How does GitHub figure in?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A clone is simply a copy of a repository. On the surface, its result is
equivalent to <code>svn checkout</code>, where you download source code from some other
repository. The difference between centralized VCS like Subversion and DVCSs
like Git is that in Git, when you clone, you are actually copying the entire
source repository, including all the history and branches. You now have a new
repository on your machine and any commits you make go into that repository.
Nobody will see any changes until you push those commits to another repository
(or the original one) or until someone pulls commits from your repository, if
it is publicly accessible.</p>
<p>A branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents
a thread of development. You usually have a master branch, but you may also
have a branch where you are working on some feature xyz, and another one to
fix bug abc. When you have checked out a branch, any commits you make will
stay on that branch and not be shared with other branches until you merge them
with or rebase them onto the branch in question. Of course, Git seems a little
weird when it comes to branches until you look at the underlying model of how
branches are implemented. Rather than explain it myself (I've already said too
much, methinks), I'll link to the "computer science" explanation of how Git
models branches and commits, taken from the Git website:</p>
<p>http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/</p>
<p>A fork isn't a Git concept really, it's more a political/social idea. That is,
if some people aren't happy with the way a project is going, they can take the
source code and work on it themselves separate from the original developers.
That would be considered a fork. Git makes forking easy because everyone
already has their own "master" copy of the source code, so it's as simple as
cutting ties with the original project developers and doesn't require
exporting history from a shared repository like you might have to do with SVN.</p>
<p>EDIT: since I was not aware of the modern definition of "fork" as used by
sites such as GitHub, please take a look at the comments and also Michael
Durrant's answer below mine for more information.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>It doesn't really matter if your solution is slow.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>You can do:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git log -S &lt;search string&gt; --source --all
</pre></div>

<p>To find all commits that added or removed the <strong>fixed string</strong> <code>search
string</code>. The <code>--all</code> parameter means to start from every branch and <code>--source</code>
means to show which of those branches led to finding that commit. It's often
useful to add <code>-p</code> to show the patches that each of those commits would
introduce as well.</p>
<p>Versions of git since 1.7.4 also have a similar <strong><code>-G</code> option, which takes a
regular expression</strong>. This actually has different (and rather more obvious)
semantics, explained in this blog post from Junio Hamano.</p>
<p>As thameera points out in the comments, you need to put quotes around the
search term if it contains spaces or other special characters, for example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git log -S 'hello world' --source --all
git log -S "dude, where's my car?" --source --all
</pre></div>

<p>Here's an example using <code>-G</code> to find occurrences of <code>function foo() {</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git log -G "^(\s)*function foo[(][)](\s)*{$" --source --all
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>--reverse</strong> is also helpful since you want the first commit that made the
change:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git log --all -p --reverse --source -S 'needle'
</pre></div>

<p>This way older commits will appear first.</p>

    <p>In Python, I can compile a regular expression to be case-insensitive using
<code>re.compile</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'TeSt'
&gt;&gt;&gt; casesensitive = re.compile('test')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ignorecase = re.compile('test', re.IGNORECASE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print casesensitive.match(s)
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ignorecase.match(s)
&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x02F0B608&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Is there a way to do the same, but without using <code>re.compile</code>. I can't find
anything like Perl's <code>i</code> suffix (e.g. <code>m/test/i</code>) in the documentation.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Pass <code>re.IGNORECASE</code> to the <code>flags</code> param of <code>search</code>, <code>match</code>, or <code>sub</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">re.search('test', 'TeSt', re.IGNORECASE)
re.match('test', 'TeSt', re.IGNORECASE)
re.sub('test', 'xxxx', 'Testing', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
</pre></div>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You can also perform case insensitive searches using search/match without the
IGNORECASE flag (tested in Python 2.7.3):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">re.search(r'(?i)test', 'TeSt').group()    ## returns 'TeSt'
re.match(r'(?i)test', 'TeSt').group()     ## returns 'TeSt'
