    <p>I have a text in a textarea and I read it out using the .value attribute.</p>
<p>Now I would like to remove all linebreaks (the character that is produced when
you press <code>Enter</code>) from my text now using .replace with a regular expression,
but how do I indicate a linebreak in a regex?</p>
<p>If that is not possible, is there another way?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Line breaks (better: newlines) can be one of Carriage Return (CR, <code>\r</code>, on
older Macs), Line Feed (LF, <code>\n</code>, on Unices incl. Linux) or CR followed by LF
(<code>\r\n</code>, on WinDOS). (Contrary to another answer, this has <em>nothing</em> to do
with character encoding.)</p>
<p>Therefore, the most efficient <code>RegExp</code> literal to match all variants is</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">/\r?\n|\r/
</pre></div>

<p>If you want to match all newlines in a string, use a global match,</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">/\r?\n|\r/g
</pre></div>

<p>respectively. Then proceed with the <code>replace</code> method as suggested in several
other answers. (Probably you do <em>not</em> want to remove the newlines, but replace
them with other whitespace, for example the space character, so that words
remain intact.)</p>

    <p>In Android API 11+, Google has released a new class called <code>Fragment</code>.</p>
<p>In the videos, Google suggests that whenever possible (link1, link2), we
should use fragments instead of activities, but they didn't explain exactly
why.</p>
<p>What's the purpose of fragments and some possible uses of them (other than
some UI examples that can be easily be achieved by simple views/layouts)?</p>
<p>My question is about fragments:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the purposes of using a fragment?</li>
<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using fragments compared to using activities/views/layouts?</li>
</ol>
<p>Bonus questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you give some really interesting uses for fragments? Things that Google didn't mention in their videos?</li>
<li>What's the best way to communicate between fragments and the activities that contain them?</li>
<li>What are the most important things to remember when you use fragments? Any tips and warnings from your experience?</li>

<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<blockquote>
<h2>1 &amp; #2 what are the purposes of using a fragment &amp; what are the advantages</h2>
<p>and disadvantages of using fragments compared to using
activities/views/layouts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fragments are Android's solution to creating reusable user interfaces. You can
achieve some of the same things using activities and layouts (for example by
using includes). However; fragments are wired in to the Android API, from
HoneyComb, and up. Let me elaborate;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>ActionBar</code>. If you want tabs up there to navigate your app, you quickly see that <code>ActionBar.TabListener</code> interface gives you a <code>FragmentTransaction</code> as an input argument to the <code>onTabSelected</code> method. You could probably ignore this, and do something else and clever, but you'd be working against the API, not with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>FragmentManager</code> handles «back» for you in a very clever way. Back does not mean back to the last activity, like for regular activities. It means back to the previous fragment state. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the cool <code>ViewPager</code> with a <code>FragmentPagerAdapter</code> to create swipe interfaces. The <code>FragmentPagerAdapter</code> code is much cleaner than a regular adapter, and it controls instantiations of the individual fragments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your life will be a lot easier if you use Fragments when you try to create applications for both phones and tablets. Since the fragments are so tied in with the Honeycomb+ APIs, you will want to use them on phones as well to reuse code. That's where the compatibility library comes in handy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You even could and should use fragments for apps meant for phones only. If you have portability in mind. I use <code>ActionBarSherlock</code> and the compatibility libraries to create "ICS looking" apps, that look the same all the way back to version 1.6. You get the latest features like the <code>ActionBar</code>, with tabs, overflow, split action bar, viewpager etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonus 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way to communicate between fragments are intents. When you press
something in a Fragment you would typically call <code>StartActivity()</code> with data
on it. The intent is passed on to all fragments of the activity you launch.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Not sure what video(s) you are referring to, but I doubt they are saying you
should use fragments instead of activities, because they are not directly
interchangeable. There is actually a fairly detailed entry in the Dev Guide,
consider reading it for details.</p>
<p>In short, fragments live inside activities, and each activity can host many
fragments. Like activities, they have a specific lifecycle, unlike activities,
they are not top-level application components. Advantages of fragments include
code reuse and modularity (e.g., using the same list view in many activities),
including the ability to build multi-pane interfaces (mostly useful on
tablets). The main disadvantage is (some) added complexity. You can generally
achieve the same thing with (custom) views in a non-standard and less robust
way.</p>

<p>Please tell me where am I going wrong.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Inside single quotes everything is preserved literally, without exception.</p>
<p>That means you have to close the quotes, insert something, and then re-enter
again.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="s1">'before'</span><span class="s2">"$variable"</span><span class="s1">'after'</span>
<span class="s1">'before'</span><span class="s2">"'"</span><span class="s1">'after'</span>
<span class="s1">'before'</span>\<span class="s1">''</span><span class="n">after</span><span class="s1">'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Word concatenation is simply done by juxtaposition. As you can verify, each of
the above lines is a single word to the shell. Quotes (single or double
quotes, depending on the situation) don't isolate words. They are only used to
disable interpretation of various special characters, like whitespace, <code>$</code>,
<code>;</code>... For a good tutorial on quoting see Mark Reed's answer. Also relevant:
Which characters need to be escaped in bash?</p>
<h3>Do not concatenate strings interpreted by a shell</h3>
<p>You should absolutely avoid building shell commands by concatenating
variables. This is a bad idea similar to concatenation of SQL fragments (SQL
injection!).</p>
<p>Usually it is possible to have placeholders in the command, and to supply the
command together with variables so that the callee can receive them from the
invocation arguments list.</p>
<p>For example, the following is very unsafe. DON'T DO THIS</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"echo </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">Argument 1 is: $myvar</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sh</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"$script"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If the contents of <code>$myvar</code> is untrusted, here is an exploit:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">myvar</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'foo"; echo "you were hacked'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Instead of the above invocation, use positional arguments. The following
invocation is better -- it's not exploitable:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'echo "arg 1 is: $1"'</span>
<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sh</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"$script"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"$myvar"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note the use of single ticks in the assignment to <code>script</code>, which means that
it's taken literally, without variable expansion or any other form of
interpretation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The <code>repo</code> command can't care what kind of quotes it gets. If you need
parameter expansion, use double quotes. If that means you wind up having to
backslash a lot of stuff, use single quotes for most of it, and then break out
of them and go into doubles for the part where you need the expansion to
happen.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">repo forall -c 'literal stuff goes here; '"stuff with $parameters here"' more literal stuff'
</pre></div>

<p>Explanation follows, if you're interested.</p>
<p>When you run a command from the shell, what that command receives as arguments
is an array of null-terminated strings. Those strings may contain absolutely
<em>any</em> non-null character.</p>
<p>But when the shell is building that array of strings from a command line, it
interprets some characters specially; this is designed to make commands easier
(indeed, possible) to type. For instance, spaces normally indicate the
boundary between strings in the array; for that reason, the individual
arguments are sometimes called "words". But an argument may nonetheless have
spaces in it; you just need some way to tell the shell that's what you want.</p>
<p>You can use a backslash in front of any character (including space, or another
backslash) to tell the shell to treat that character literally. But while you
can do something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">reply=\”That\'ll\ be\ \$4.96,\ please,\"\ said\ the\ cashier
</pre></div>

<p>...it can get tiresome. So the shell offers an alternative: quotation marks.
These come in two main varieties.</p>
<p>Double-quotation marks are called "grouping quotes". They prevent wildcards
and aliases from being expanded, but mostly they're for including spaces in a
word. Other things like parameter and command expansion (the sorts of thing
signaled by a <code>$</code>) still happen. And of course if you want a literal double-
quote inside double-quotes, you have to backslash it:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">reply="\"That'll be \$4.96, please,\" said the cashier"
</pre></div>

<p>Single-quotation marks are more draconian. Everything between them is taken
completely literally, including backslashes. There is absolutely no way to get
a literal single quote inside single quotes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, quotation marks in the shell <em>are not word delimiters</em> ; by
themselves, they don't terminate a word. You can go in and out of quotes,
including between different types of quotes, within the same word to get the
desired result:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">reply='"That'\''ll be $4.96, please," said the cashier'
</pre></div>

<p>So that's easier - a lot fewer backslashes, although the close-single-quote,
backslashed-literal-single-quote, open-single-quote sequence takes some
getting used to.</p>
<p>Modern shells have added another quoting style not specified by the POSIX
standard, in which the leading single quotation mark is prefixed with a dollar
sign. Strings so quoted follow similar conventions to string literals in the
ANSI standard version of the C programming language, and are therefore
sometimes called "ANSI strings" and the <code>$'</code>...<code>'</code> pair "ANSI quotes". Within
such strings, the above advice about backslashes being taken literally no
longer applies. Instead, they become special again - not only can you include
a literal single quotation mark or backslash by prepending a backslash to it,
but the shell also expands the ANSI C character escapes (like <code>\n</code> for a
newline, <code>\t</code> for tab, and <code>\xHH</code> for the character with hexadecimal code
<code>HH</code>). Otherwise, however, they behave as single-quoted strings: no parameter
or command substitution takes place:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">reply=$'"That\'ll be $4.96, please," said the cashier'
</pre></div>

<p>The important thing to note is that the single string that gets stored in the
<code>reply</code> variable is <em>exactly the same</em> in all of these examples. Similarly,
after the shell is done parsing a command line, there is no way for the
command being run to tell exactly how each argument string was actually typed
– or even <em>if</em> it was typed, rather than being created programmatically
somehow.</p>
