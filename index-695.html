    <p>I am trying to fix a <code>div</code> so it always sticks to the top of the screen,
using:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">position</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">fixed</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">top</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="n">right</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>However, the <code>div</code> is inside a centered container. When I use <code>position:fixed</code>
it fixes the <code>div</code> relative to the browser window, such as it's up against the
right side of the browser. Instead, it should be fixed relative to the
container.</p>
<p>I know that <code>position:absolute</code> can be used to fix an element relative to the
<code>div</code>, but when you scroll down the page the element vanishes and doesn't
stick to the top as with <code>position:fixed</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a hack or workaround to achieve this?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Short answer: <del>no.</del> (It is now possible with CSS transform. See the edit
below)</p>
<p>Long answer: The problem with using "fixed" positioning is that it takes the
element <strong>out of flow</strong>. thus it can't be re-positioned relative to its parent
because it's as if it didn't have one. If, however, the container is of a
fixed, known width, you can use something like:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">#</span><span class="nn">fixedContainer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">position</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">fixed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">width</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">600</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">height</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">left</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">top</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">margin-left</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">-300</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c">/*half the width*/</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Edit (03/2015):</h4>
<p>This is outdated information. It is now possible to center content of an
dynamic size (horizontally and vertically) with the help of the magic of CSS3
transform. The same principle applies, but instead of using margin to offset
your container, you can use <code>translateX(-50%)</code>. This doesn't work with the
above margin trick because you don't know how much to offset it unless the
width is fixed and you can't use relative values (like <code>50%</code>) because it will
be relative to the parent and not the element it's applied to. <code>transform</code>
behaves differently. Its values are relative to the element they are applied
to. Thus, <code>50%</code> for <code>transform</code> means half the width of the element, while
<code>50%</code> for margin is half of the parent's width. This is an IE9+ solution</p>
<p>Using similar code to the above example, I recreated the same scenario using
completely dynamic width and height:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">fixedContainer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mh">#ddd</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">position</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">fixed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">padding</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="kt">em</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">left</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">top</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">transform</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">translateX</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">-50</span><span class="err">%</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you want it to be centered, you can do that too:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">fixedContainer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mh">#ddd</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">position</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">fixed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">padding</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="kt">em</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">left</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">top</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">transform</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">translate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">-50</span><span class="err">%</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">-50</span><span class="err">%</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Actually this is possible and the accepted answer only deals with
centralising, which is straightforward enough. Also you really don't need to
use JavaScript.</p>
<h4>This will let you deal with any scenario:</h4>
<p>Set everything up as you would if you want to position: absolute inside a
position: relative container, and then create a new fixed position div inside
the div with <code>position: absolute</code>, but do <strong>not</strong> set its top and left
properties. It will then be fixed wherever you want it, relative to the
container.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">/*<span class="w"> </span>Main<span class="w"> </span>site<span class="w"> </span>body<span class="w"> </span>*/
.wrapper<span class="w"> </span>{

    <p>What does RESTful Authentication mean and how does it work? I can't find a
good overview on Google. My only understanding is that you pass the session
key (remeberal) in the URL, but this could be horribly wrong.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>How to handle authentication in a RESTful Client-Server architecture is a
matter of debate.</p>
<p>Commonly, it can be achieved, in the SOA over HTTP world via:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP basic auth over HTTPS;</li>
<li>Cookies and session management;</li>
<li>Token in HTTP headers (e.g. <em>OAuth</em> 2.0 + JWT);</li>
<li>Query Authentication with additional signature parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll have to adapt, or even better mix those techniques, to match your
software architecture at best.</p>
<p>Each authentication scheme has its own PROs and CONs, depending on the purpose
of your security policy and software architecture.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP basic auth over HTTPS</strong></p>
<p>This first solution, based on the standard HTTPS protocol, is used by most web
services.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nf">GET</span> <span class="nn">/spec.html</span> <span class="kr">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span>
<span class="na">Host</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="l">www.example.org</span>
<span class="na">Authorization</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="l">Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It's easy to implement, available by default on all browsers, but has some
known drawbacks, like the awful authentication window displayed on the
Browser, which will persist (there is no LogOut-like feature here), some
server-side additional CPU consumption, and the fact that the user-name and
password are transmitted (over HTTPS) into the Server (it should be more
secure to let the password stay only on the client side, during keyboard
entry, and be stored as secure hash on the Server).</p>
<p>We may use Digest Authentication, but it requires also HTTPS, since it is
vulnerable to MiM or Replay attacks, and is specific to HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>Session via Cookies</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, a session managed on the Server is not truly Stateless.</p>
<p>One possibility could be to maintain all data within the cookie content. And,
by design, the cookie is handled on the Server side (Client, in fact, does
even not try to interpret this cookie data: it just hands it back to the
server on each successive request). But this cookie data is application state
data, so the client should manage it, not the server, in a pure Stateless
world.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nf">GET</span> <span class="nn">/spec.html</span> <span class="kr">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span>
<span class="na">Host</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="l">www.example.org</span>
<span class="na">Cookie</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="l">theme=light; sessionToken=abc123</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The cookie technique itself is HTTP-linked, so it's not truly RESTful, which
should be protocol-independent, IMHO. It is vulnerable to MiM or Replay
attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Granted via Token (OAuth2)</strong></p>
<p>An alternative is to put a token within the HTTP headers so that the request
is authenticated. This is what <em>OAuth</em> 2.0 does, for instance. See the RFC
6749:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
 Host: example.com
 Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
</pre></div>

<p>In short, this is very similar to a cookie and suffers to the same issues: not
stateless, relying on HTTP transmission details, and subject to a lot of
security weaknesses - including MiM and Replay - so is to be used only over
HTTPS. Typically, a JWT is used as a token.</p>
<p><strong>Query Authentication</strong></p>
<p>Query Authentication consists in signing each RESTful request via some
additional parameters on the URI. See this reference article.</p>
<p>It was defined as such in this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All REST queries must be authenticated by signing the query parameters
sorted in lower-case, alphabetical order using the private credential as the
signing token. Signing should occur before URL encoding the query string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This technique is perhaps the more compatible with a Stateless architecture,
and can also be implemented with a light session management (using in-memory
sessions instead of DB persistence).</p>
<p>For instance, here is a generic URI sample from the link above:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">GET /object?apiKey=Qwerty2010</span>
</pre></div>

<p>should be transmitted as such:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="err">GET /object?timestamp=1261496500&amp;apiKey=Qwerty2010&amp;signature=abcdef0123456789</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The string being signed is <code>/object?apikey=Qwerty2010&amp;timestamp=1261496500</code>
and the signature is the SHA256 hash of that string using the private
component of the API key.</p>
<p>Server-side data caching can be always available. For instance, in our
framework, we cache the responses at the SQL level, not at the URI level. So
adding this extra parameter doesn't break the cache mechanism.</p>
<p>See this article for some details about RESTful authentication in our client-
server ORM/SOA/MVC framework, based on JSON and REST. Since we allow
communication not only over HTTP/1.1, but also named pipes or GDI messages
(locally), we tried to implement a truly RESTful authentication pattern, and
not rely on HTTP specificity (like header or cookies).</p>
<p><em>Later Note</em> : adding a signature in the URI can be seen as bad practice
(since for instance it will appear in the http server logs) so it has to be
mitigated, e.g. by a proper TTL to avoid replays. But if your http logs are
compromised, you will certainly have bigger security problems.</p>
<p>In practice, the upcoming MAC Tokens Authentication for OAuth 2.0 may be a
huge improvement in respect to the "Granted by Token" current scheme. But this
is still a work in progress and is tied to HTTP transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It's worth concluding that REST is not only HTTP-based, even if, in practice,
it's also mostly implemented over HTTP. REST can use other communication
layers. So a RESTful authentication is not just a synonym of HTTP
authentication, whatever Google answers. It should even not use the HTTP
mechanism at all but shall be abstracted from the communication layer. And if
you use HTTP communication, thanks to the Let's Encrypt initiative there is no
reason not to use proper HTTPS, which is required in addition to any
authentication scheme.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I doubt whether the people enthusiastically shouting "HTTP Authentication"
ever tried making a browser-based application (instead of a machine-to-machine
web service) with REST (no offense intended - I just don't think they ever
faced the complications).</p>
<p>Problems I found with using HTTP Authentication on RESTful services that
produce HTML pages to be viewed in a browser are:</p>
<ul>
<li>user typically gets an ugly browser-made login box, which is very user-unfriendly. you cannot add password retrieval, help boxes, etcetera.</li>
<li>logging out or logging in under a different name is a problem - browsers will keep sending authentication information to the site until you close the window</li>
<li>timeouts are difficult</li>
</ul>
<p>A very insightful article that tackles these point by point is here, but this
results in a <em>lot</em> of browser-specific javascript hackery, workarounds for
workarounds, et cetera. As such, it is also not forward-compatible so will
require constant maintenance as new browsers are released. I do not consider
that clean and clear design, plus I feel it is a lot of extra work and
headache just so that I can enthusiastically show my REST-badge to my friends.</p>
<p>I believe cookies are the solution. But wait, cookies are evil, aren't they?
No, they're not, the way cookies are often used is evil. A cookie itself is
just a piece of client-side information, just like the HTTP authentication
info that the browser would keep track of while you browse. And this piece of
client-side information is sent to the server at every request, again just
like the HTTP Authentication info would be. Conceptually, the only difference
is that the <em>content</em> of this piece of client-side state can be determined by
the <em>server</em> as part of its response.</p>
<p>By making sessions a RESTful resource with just the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>session</em> maps a key to a user id (and possibly a last-action-timestamp for timeouts)</li>
<li>If a <em>session</em> exists, then that means that the key is valid.</li>
<li>Login means POSTing to /sessions, a new key is set as a cookie</li>
<li>Logout means DELETEing /sessions/{key} (with the overloaded POST, remember, we're a browser, and HTML 5 is a long way to go yet)</li>
<li>Authentication is done by sending the key as a cookie at every request and checking whether the session exists and is valid</li>
</ul>
<p>The only difference to HTTP Authentication, now, is that the authentication
key is generated by the server and sent to the client who keeps sending it
back, instead of the client computing it from the entered credentials.</p>
<p>converter42 adds that when using https (which we should), it is important that
the cookie will have its secure flag set so that authentication info is never
sent over a non-secure connection. Great point, hadn't seen it myself.</p>
<p>I feel that this is a sufficient solution that works fine, but I must admit
that I'm not enough of a security expert to identify potential holes in this
scheme - all I know is that hundreds of non-RESTful web applications use
essentially the same login protocol ($_SESSION in PHP, HttpSession in Java EE,
etc.). The cookie header contents are simply used to address a server-side
resource, just like an accept-language might be used to access translation
resources, etcetera. I feel that it is the same, but maybe others don't? What
do you think, guys?</p>

    <p>I'm able to access my laptop web server using the Android emulator, I'm using
<code>10.0.2.2:portno</code> works well.</p>
<p>But when I connect my real Android phone, the phone browser can't connect to
the same web server on my laptop. The phone is connected to the laptop using a
USB cable. If I run the adb devices command, I can see my phone.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>USB doesn't provide network to mobile device.</p>
<p><strong>If both your desktop and phone are connected to the same WiFi</strong> (or any
other local network), then use your desktop IP address assigned by the router
(not <code>localhost</code> and not <code>127.0.0.1</code>).</p>
<p>To find out the IP address of your desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>type into the command line <code>ipconfig</code> (Windows) or <code>ifconfig</code> (Unix) <ul>
<li>on Linux the one-liner <code>ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1</code> will yield only the important stuff</li>
<li>there's a bunch of suggestions on how to have a similar output on Windows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there's going to be a bunch of IP's</li>
<li>try all of them (except the forementioned <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If your phone is connected to the mobile network</strong> , then things are going
to be harder.</p>
<p>Either go hardcore:</p>
<ul>
<li>first find out your router external IP address (https://www.google.de/search?q=myip)</li>
<li>then, on the router, forward some port to <code>&lt;your desktop IP&gt;:&lt;server port number&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>finally use the external IP address and forwarded port</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise use something like xip.io or ngrok.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : The <code>ifconfig</code> command has been deprecated and thus missing by
default on Debian Linux, starting from Debian stretch. The new and recommended
alternative for examining a network configuration on Debian Linux is ip
command. For example to use ip command to display a network configuration run
the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ip address
</pre></div>

<p>The above ip command can be abbreviated to:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">ip a
</pre></div>

<p>If you still prefer to use <code>ifconfig</code> as part of your daily sys admin routine,
you can easily install it as part of the <code>net-tools</code> package.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">install</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">net</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tools</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Reference is here</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>It is actually quite simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on WiFi Hotspot of your Android phone/router and connect your Laptop to your phone</li>
<li>Start your server at <code>localhost</code> (I am using WAMP server for Windows)</li>
<li>
<p>Now open the command prompt and enter </p>
<p>ipconfig</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've done that, you will see something like the following:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Wireless LAN adapter Wireless Network Connection:
  Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
  Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::80bc:e378:19ab:e448%11
  IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.43.76
  Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
  Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.43.1
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Copy the IPv4 Address (in this case, it is <code>192.168.43.76</code>)</li>
<li>In your mobile browser, simply paste the IPv4 Address</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Note: <strong>Please set your network as " <em>Home Network</em> ".</strong> Setting the network
as Home Network means that you are allowing your PC to share stuff with other
devices on the same network.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows 10, this can be done with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <em>Settings</em>
</li>
<li>Go to <em>Network &amp; Internet</em>
</li>
<li>Select <em>WiFi</em> in the left menu</li>
<li>Tap on the name of the connected WiFi</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Network Profile</strong> of the network to be <em>Private</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are having an issue, it is most likely to do with Windows Firewall.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <em>Control Panel</em>
</li>
<li>Go to <em>Windows Defender Firewall</em>
</li>
<li>Tap on <strong>Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall</strong>
</li>
<li>Check whether the app is enabled for <strong>Private</strong> networks (there should be a tick)</li>
<li>If it is <em>not</em> enabled, tap <strong>Change settings</strong> and tick the checkbox under <strong>Private</strong> for the app</li>
</ul>
