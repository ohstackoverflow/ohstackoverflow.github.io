    <p>I prototyped a tiny search engine with PageRank that worked on my computer. I
am interested in building a Knowledge Graph on top of it, and it should return
only queried webpages that are within the right context, similarly to how
Google found relevant answers to search questions. I saw a lot of publicity
around Knowledge Graphs, but not a lot of literature and almost no pseudocode
like guideline of building one. Does anyone know good references on how such
Knowledge Graphs work internally, so that there will be no need to create
models about a KG?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Knowledge graph is a buzzword. It is a sum of models and technologies put
together to achieve a result. The first stop on your journey starts with
Natural language processing, Ontologies and Text mining. It is a wide field of
artificial intelligence, go here for a research survey on the field.</p>
<p>Before building your own models, I suggest you try different standard
algorithms using dedicated toolboxes such as gensim. You will learn about tf-
idf, LDA, document feature vectors, etc.</p>
<p>I am assuming you want to work with text data, if you want to do image search
using other images it is different. Same for the audio part.</p>
<p>Building models is only the first step, the most difficult part of Google's
knowledge graph is to actually scale to billions of requests each day ...</p>
<p>A good processing pipeline can be built "easily" on top of Apache Spark, "the
current-gen Hadoop". It provides a resilient distributed datastore which is
mandatory if you want to scale.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your data as a graph, as in graph theory (like pagerank),
for live querying, I suggest you use Bulbs which is a framework which is "Like
an ORM for graphs, but instead of SQL, you use the graph-traversal language
Gremlin to query the database". You can switch the backend from Neo4j to
OpenRDF (useful if you do ontologies) for instance.</p>
<p>For graph analytics you can use Spark, GraphX module or GraphLab.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I know I'm really late but first to clarify some terminology: Knowledge Graph
and Ontology are similar (I'm talking in the Semantic Web paradigm). In the
semantic web stack the foundation is RDF which is a language for defining
graphs as triples (Subject, Predicate, Object). RDFS is a layer on top of RDF.
It defines a meta-model, e.g., predicates such as rdf:type and nodes such as
rdfs:Class. Although RDFS provides a meta-model there is no logical foundation
for it so there are no reasoners that can validate the model or do further
reasoning on it. The layer on top of RDFS is OWL (Web Ontology Language). That
has a formal semantics defined by Description Logic which is a decidable
subset of First Order Logic. It has more predefined nodes and links such as
owl:Class, owl:ObjectProperty, etc. So when people use the term ontology they
typically mean an OWL model. When they use the term Knowledge Graph it may
refer to an ontology defined in OWL (because OWL is still ultimately an RDF
graph) or it may mean just a graph in RDF/RDFS.</p>
<p>I said that because IMO the best way to build a knowledge graph is to define
an ontology and then use various semantic web tools to load data (e.g., from
spreadsheets) into the ontology. The best tool to start with IMO is the
Protege ontology editor from Stanford. It's free and for a free open source
tool very reliable and intuitive. And there is a good tutorial for how to use
Protege and learn OWL as well as other Semantic Web tools such as SPARQL and
SHACL. That tutorial can be found here: New Protege Pizza Tutorial
(disclosure: that links to my site, I wrote the tutorial). If you want to get
into the lower levels of the graph you probably want to check out a
triplestore. It is a graph database designed for OWL and RDF models. The free
version of Franz Inc's AllegroGraph triplestore is easy to use and supports 5M
triples. Another good triplestore that is free and open source is part of the
Apache Jena framework.</p>

    <p><strong><em>How can I measure the speed of code written in Java?</em></strong></p>
<p>I planning to develop software which will solve Sudoku using all presently
available AI and ML algorithms and compare time against simple brute-force
method. I need to measure time of each algorithm, I would like to ask for
suggestions on what is the best way of doing that? Very important, program
must be useful on any machine regardless to CPU power/memory.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>As suggested by others, <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> is quite good, but note
the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> measures elapsed physical time ("wall clock time"), not CPU time. If other applications are running on the machine, your code will get less CPU and its speed will decrease. So, bench only on otherwise idle systems.</li>
<li>Similarly, a multi-threaded application on a multicore system may get extra, hidden CPU. The elapsed time measure does not capture the whole of the complexity of multi-threaded applications.</li>
<li>Java needs a bit of "warm-up". The VM will first interpret code (which is slow), and, if a given method is used too many times, then the JIT compiler will translate the method to native code. Only at that point will the method reach its top speed. I recommend that you perform a few "empty loops" before calling <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>.</li>
<li>Accuracy of <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> is rarely of 1 ms. On many systems, accuracy is no better than 10 ms, or even more. Also, the JVM will sometimes run the GC, inducing noticeable pauses. I suggest that you organize your measure in a loop and insist upon running for at least a few seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you see, there is first ten "empty" runs. Then the program runs the method
in a loop, as many times as necessary so that the loop takes at least ten
seconds. Ten seconds ought to be enough to smooth out GC runs and other system
inaccuracies. When I bench hash function implementations, I use two seconds,
and even though the function itself triggers no memory allocation at all, I
still get variations of up to 3%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>I usually use</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">System.currentTimeMillis()
</pre></div>

<p>to calculate deltas of time:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">long</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">start</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">System</span>.<span class="nv">currentTimeMillis</span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="c1">;</span>
<span class="cm">/* do your algorithm iteration */</span>
<span class="nv">long</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">elapsed</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">System</span>.<span class="nv">currentTimeMillis</span><span class="ss">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">start</span><span class="c1">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Mind that depending on the operating system you use the precision of the
funcion could be greater than 1 millisecond (also tenth of msecs) so you'll
have to tweak it to be useful for your analysis.</p>
<p>EDIT: there is also the alternative of doing the same thing with
<code>System.nanoTime()</code> but you don't have any guarantee that accuracy will be of
nanoseconds.</p>

    <p>Both methods have a data structure which holds the nodes (with their cost) to
expand. Both methods first expand the node with the best cost. So, what is the
difference between them?</p>
<p>I was told that uniform-cost search is a blind method and best-first search is
not, which confused me even more (both have information about node costs or
not?).</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The difference is in the heuristic function.</p>
<p>Uniform-cost search is <em>uninformed</em> search: it doesn't use any domain
knowledge. It expands the least cost node, and it does so in every direction
because no information about the goal is provided. It can be viewed as a
function <code>f(n) = g(n)</code> where <code>g(n)</code> is a path cost ("path cost" itself is a
function that assigns a numeric cost to a path with respect to performance
measure, e.g. distance in kilometers, or number of moves etc.). It simply is a
cost to reach node <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>Best-first search is <em>informed</em> search: it uses a heuristic function to
estimate how close the current state is to the goal (are we getting close to
the goal?). Hence our cost function <code>f(n) = g(n)</code> is combined with the cost to
get from n to the goal, the <code>h(n)</code> (heuristic function that estimates that
cost) giving us <code>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</code>. An example of a best-first search
algorithm is <strong>A</strong>* algorithm.</p>
<p>Yes, both methods have a list of expanded nodes, but <strong>best-first search will
try to minimize that number of expanded nodes</strong> (path cost + heuristic
function).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>There is a little misunderstanding in here. Uniform cost search, best first
search and A<em> search algorithms are all different algorithms. </em><em>Uniform cost</em><em>
is an uninformed search algorithm when </em><em>Best First</em><em> and </em><em>A</em><em><em> search
algorithms are informed search algorithms. Informed means that it uses a
heuristic function for deciding the expanding node. Difference between best
first search and A</em> is that best first uses <code>f(n) = h(n)</code> for expanding and A</em>
uses <code>f(n) = g(n)+h(n)</code> for choosing the expanding node. <code>h(n)</code> is the
heuristic function. <code>g(n)</code> is the actual cost from starting node to node n.</p>
