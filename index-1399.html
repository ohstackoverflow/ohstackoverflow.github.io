    <p>What is the difference between informed and uninformed searches? Can you
explain this with some examples?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h4>Blind or Uniformed Search</h4>
<p>It is a search without "information" about the goal node.</p>
<p>An example an is breadth-first search (BFS). In BFS, the search proceeds one
layer after the other. In other words, nodes in the same layer are first
visited before nodes in successive layers. This is performed until a node that
is "expanded" is the goal node. In this case, no information about the goal
node is used to visit, expand or generate nodes.</p>
<p>We can think of a blind or uniformed search as a brute-force search.</p>
<h4>Heuristic or Informed Search</h4>
<p>It is a search with "information" about the goal.</p>
<p>An example of such type of algorithm is A<em>. In this algorithm, nodes are
visited and expanded using also information about the goal node. The
information about the goal node is given by an </em><em>heuristic function</em><em> (which
is a function that associates information about the goal node to each of the
nodes of the state space). In the case of A</em>, the heuristic information
associated with each node <code>n</code> is an estimate of the distance from <code>n</code> to the
goal node.</p>
<p>We can think of a informed search as a approximately "guided" search.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>An <strong>uninformed search</strong> is a brute-force or "blind" search. It uses no
knowledge about problem, hence possibly less efficient than an informed
search.</p>
<p>Examples of uninformed search algorithms are breadth-first search, depth-first
search, depth-limited search, uniform-cost search, depth-first iterative
deepening search and bidirectional search.</p>
<p>An <strong>informed search</strong> (also called "heuristic search") uses prior knowledge
about problem ("domain knowledge"), hence possibly more efficient than
uninformed search.</p>
<p>Examples of informed search algorithms are best-first search and A*.</p>

    <p>I'm playing arround with a Genetic Algorithm in which I want to evolve graphs.
Do you know a way to apply crossover and mutation when the chromosomes are
graphs?</p>
<p>Or am I missing a coding for the graphs that let me apply "regular" crossover
and mutation over bit strings?</p>
<p>thanks a lot! Any help, even if it is not directly related to my problem, is
appreciated!</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I like Sandor's suggestion of using Ken Stanley's NEAT algorithm.</p>
<p>NEAT was designed to evolve neural networks with arbitrary topologies, but
those are just basically directed graphs. There were many ways to evolve
neural networks before NEAT, but one of NEAT's most important contributions
was that it provided a way to <strong>perform meaningful crossover between two
networks that have different toplogies</strong>.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, NEAT uses historical markings attached to each gene to
"line up" the genes of two genomes during crossover (a process biologists call
synapsis). For example:</p>
<p><img alt="crossover with different topologies in NEAT" src="images/BsCYo.png"><br>
(source: natekohl.net)</p>
<p><em>(In this example, each gene is a box and represents a connection between two
nodes. The number at the top of each gene is the historical marking for that
gene.)</em></p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong> : Lining up genes based on historical markings is a principled
way to perform crossover between two networks without expensive topological
analysis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>You might as well try Genetic Programming. A graph would be the closest thing
to a tree and GP uses trees... if you still want to use GAs instead of GPs
then take a look at how crossover is performed on a GP and that might give you
an idea how to perform it on the graphs of your GA:</p>
<p><img alt="Crossover" src="images/RYLSl.gif"><br>
(source: geneticprogramming.com)</p>
<p>Here is how crossover for trees (and graphs) works:</p>
<ol>
<li>You select 2 specimens for mating.</li>
<li>You pick a random node from one parent and swap it with a random node in the other parent.</li>
<li>The resulting trees are the offspring.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Is there a way to to find all the sub-sentences of a sentence that still are
meaningful and contain at least one subject, verb, and a predicate/object?</p>
<p>For example, if we have a sentence like "I am going to do a seminar on NLP at
SXSW in Austin next month". We can extract the following meaningful sub-
sentences from this sentence: "I am going to do a seminar", "I am going to do
a seminar on NLP", "I am going to do a seminar on NLP at SXSW", "I am going to
do a seminar at SXSW", "I am going to do a seminar in Austin", "I am going to
do a seminar on NLP next month", etc.</p>
<p>Please note that there is no deduced sentences here (e.g. "There will be a NLP
seminar at SXSW next month". Although this is true, we don't need this as part
of this problem.) . All generated sentences are strictly part of the given
sentence.</p>
<p>How can we approach solving this problem? I was thinking of creating annotated
training data that has a set of legal sub-sentences for each sentence in the
training data set. And then write some supervised learning algorithm(s) to
generate a model.</p>
<p>I am quite new to NLP and Machine Learning, so it would be great if you guys
could suggest some ways to solve this problem.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There's a paper titled "Using Discourse Commitments to Recognize Textual
Entailment" by Hickl et al that discusses the extraction of discourse
commitments (sub-sentences). The paper includes a description of their
algorithm which in some level operates on rules. They used it for RTE, and
there may be some minimal levels of deduction in the output. Text
simplification maybe a related area to look at.</p>
