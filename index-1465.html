    <p>Both Hyperledger Aries and Hyperledger Indy are platforms for building
distributed ledger applications for identities.</p>
<p>What are the main differences between them? When to choose one over the other
to implement a blockchain solution?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Aries is the agent (client) part of a decentralized identity (ledger, DIDs,
verifiable credentials) application that is intended to be agnostic to the
underlying ledger/DIDs/verifiable credentials layer.</p>
<p>Indy is a decentralized identity implementation including support for a
ledger, DIDs and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Initial Aries work was to move the agent work in Indy to Aries, and so the
first working versions of Aries use Indy underneath for the decentralized
identity components. Over time, those components will become pluggable, and
additional decentralized identity components will be supported. Thus, major
parts of the indy-sdk will be deprecated, as they are implemented in Aries.</p>
<p>For building solutions, you should always be looking at Aries to start. You
will need to know what Indy does, but not the details. The only time you would
need to dive into Indy is if you what to extend its capabilities to support
your use case.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>The question is clear, what choice to make between Aries and Indy, we could
also rephrase as follows: where to start from? Indy represents, certainly, a
base layer, Aries, at the moment, is the better choice for building identity
app. Indy, infact, provides: Blockchain network, DID’s implementation, and all
features related to verifiable credentials. Aries, on top of it, helps to
build apps which can communicate over peer to peer network through secured
communication channel: DIDComm. From the user interaction point of view, Aries
is integrated with identity apps and internally talks to Indy. Aim of Aries,
obviousely, is to build an interoperable communication layer that can be
connected not only to Indy but also others blockchains framework. Indy, as the
first project in the Hyperledger family to build a decentralized identity,
offers a real-time view of the transactions and its architecture is based on
self-sovereign identity which enables users to have complete control over
their identity. At the very beginning Indy was good to build an identity
solution but, clearly, it lacks a peer to peer communication which is the
heart of identity solution. Aries has filled this part. For building solutions
there are lots of things that need to be considered but you should look at
Aries to start</p>

    <p>I have been investigating different blockchains for some use cases. In the
end, I came to the conclusion that setting up a private blockchain is
equivalent to having a distributed database with blockchain concepts like
immutability, digital signatures on top of it. Eg: Bigchaindb. (Well, If we do
need smart contract feature then distributed database might not work)</p>
<p>Theoretically, hashgraph consensus algorithm doesn't look secure enough for a
public chain. It looks like a close alternate version of Ripple.</p>
<p>In summary,</p>
<ol>
<li>Hashgraph, Ripple suits for private chain.</li>
<li>Private chain is equivalent to setting a Distributed database</li>
</ol>
<p>Here I am sharing my views, to know in what way private chain is better than a
distributed database?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Most distributed databases in existence today are fault tolerant (so they keep
running if a few nodes go down among many), but not Byzantine fault tolerant
(BFT), i.e. they can't handle arbitrary faults. Most blockchains are BFT, so
even if you don't trust some of the nodes, you can trust the overall system.</p>
<p>Most distributed databases allow the change or deletion of data. (There are
some interesting exceptions here, but I digress.) Most blockchains do not.</p>
<p>Most distributed databases have a central "admin" user who can do almost
anything, including change data, delete data, delete entire
tables/collections, or delete the entire database. Most blockchains have no
single point of control like that.</p>
<p>Until recently, BigchainDB wasn't BFT and the database admin (e.g. the MongoDB
database admin) could cause havoc. The next version will be very different: it
<em>will</em> be BFT, and it won't have any single point of control (i.e. no more
global admin or anything similar).</p>

    <p>What happened exactly on chaincode deploy and invoke , query, in Hyperledger?</p>
<p>Need to confirm the cost of system on Chaincode deploy, invoke and query. If
they are the same, seems better to make Chaincode more than one, even
hundreds, thousands.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>During “ <strong>Deploy</strong> ” the chain code is submitted to the ledger in a form of
transaction and distributed to all nodes in the network. Each node creates new
Docker container with this chaincode embedded. After that container will be
started and Init method will be executed.</p>
<p>During “ <strong>Query</strong> ” - chain code will read the current state and send it back
to user. This transaction is not saved in blockchain.</p>
<p>During “ <strong>Invoke</strong> ” - chaincode can modify the state of the variables in
ledger. Each “Invoke” transaction will be added to the “block” in the ledger.</p>
