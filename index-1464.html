<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Your code requires Solidity 0.8.7, but the imported SafeMathChainlink.sol
requires Solidity 0.6.*.</p>
<p>An easy solution is to change your code to require v0.6 as well and compile
with this version.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
</pre></div>

<p>Or you can remove the <code>import</code> and <code>using ... for</code> of the SafeMath library, as
it's not needed on 0.8 anymore. All validations performed in the library are
now performed on the language level since version 0.8.0.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Now we can use this line of code to include a range of version of solidity to
use. I faced the similar issue and got fixed by doing this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">pragma solidity &gt;=0.4.22 &lt;0.9.0;

    <p>I know a bunch of crypto wallets which works in IFRAMEs and similar
technologies right inside a web browser without needing to install any
plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://authereum.org</li>
<li>https://www.portis.io</li>
<li>https://tor.us</li>
<li>https://fortmatic.com</li>
</ul>
<p>But are they protected from a phishing Dapp attack? In case Dapp wants to
trick you and hide the actual amount of ETH send or any other way, modify
wallet UI inside a web browser?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>Storage isolation</strong></p>
<p>Extensions:</p>
<p>Browser extension-based wallets such as MetaMask use isolated local storage
that only the extension can access, with no way for a website to access. The
extension can push data to the website, or the website can request data by
doing message passing requests. Private keys are stored in the sandboxed local
storage and requests are made from the website to the extension to sign
messages. The extension returns the signed message to the website.</p>
<p>Web-based:</p>
<p>Browser-based crypto wallets such as Authereum, Portis, Torus, and Fortmatic,
use sandboxed local storage as well via an iframe. Unlike cookies, local
storage is strictly restricted by domain, meaning that if a website sets a
value in local storage, then only that website can read the value; so
alice.com cannot read bob.com's local storage. To sandbox local storage
sensitive values, they are set under a controlled subdomain, for example
x.wallet.com, since no other website will be able to read the local storage.
This subdomain contains no UI is meant for iframed communication only. The
web3 provider's of those wallets load a hidden iframe on the website, which is
used to communicate to the subdomain containing the sandboxed storage; so for
example Alice on dapp.com using Authereum, the Authereum sdk connects to
x.authereum.org using an iframe and send postMessage requests to the iframe
from the website to sign messages. This restricts the website from reading
sensitive data such as private keys and only allow the website to send sign
requests similarly to how wallet extensions work.</p>
<p>Not all web-based wallets have sandboxed local storage so you should avoid
using those since any website can read the stored sensitive data but the
wallets mentioned here are safe in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>Protection against phishing attacks</strong></p>
<p>Phishing attacks occur when a user is tricked into thinking they are using a
known website but instead are using a malicious website that resembles the
legitimate website. Authereum, Portis, and Torus are username and password
based login solutions so they open up the login auth window in a new popup or
redirect. This allows the user to verify the domain of the website for
legitimacy. Google auth does this pattern as well. Besides opening a new
window on login for the user to verify, some web-based wallet providers also
open a new window when signing messages and transactions to verify the
request.</p>
<p>Click jacking occurs when a website is loaded via an iframe on the website and
the website overlays a different UI on top of the iframed website with
pointer-events set to none and then tricks the user into entering information
or clicking a button on the overlayed UI but they are actually clicking a
button on the iframed website. This is dangerous because the action on the
iframed website can be something like sending funds to the attackers wallet.</p>
<p>To prevent the wallet site to be loaded in an iframe at all, all the wallet
site has to do is set the HTTP header <code>X-Frame-Options: DENY</code>, which is what
Authereum and Portis are doing so they are safe from these attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Trusting content scripts</strong></p>
<p>It's easy to verify browser extension source code by using source viewer
plugins, but to avoid an extension from auto-updating with malicious code, a
user can install the extension manually to lock it down to a version by
getting the source code from github if it's open source or from downloading
the source scripts.</p>
<p>Since with web-based wallets the wallet site owner controls the content
scripts then you have to trust that the content scripts managing the sensitive
key data won't be malicious since the wallet site owner or an attacker that
got access to the wallet site can at any point update the website source code
with bad code.</p>
<p>To trust content scripts, the wallet site can be hosted on IPFS since the web
address is the content hash meaning you can trust that it won't change.
Authereum is one wallet that already offers this by visiting authereum.eth or
by resolving the <code>contenthash</code> property of their ENS name.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Web-based wallets are portable because you can use the same wallet on any OS,
browser, desktop or mobile, while with browser extension you are stuck with
the environment you are using the extension from. Extensions are highly
inconvenient but offer more storage isolation guarantees. With contract-based
accounts however, more security features can be offered on the wallet side.</p>
<p><strong>Contract-based accounts</strong></p>
<p>MetaMask, Portis, Torus, and Fortmatic are all externally-owned account based
(EOA) which means that funds are stored and manged by a single key. If an
attacker gains access to the signing key, then they also have access to the
funds stored at that key.</p>
<p>Contract-based accounts (CBA), such as Authereum, provide more security
guarantees because each account contract can have multiple keys to manage it
and each key may also have limited authority over what actions it can do.</p>
<p>Advantages of contract-based accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funds are not stored on a single key</li>
<li>You can cycle through management keys</li>
<li>Account recovery, in case your management keys are stolen or lost</li>
<li>Transfer and withdraw limits </li>
<li>Access controls for keys, meaning you can restrict what methods a key can invoke</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I am a cofounder of Authereum, one of the wallets listed in the
question.</em></p>
<p>To answer your original question, yes many web-based crypto wallets are safe.
As you mentioned, some wallets use iframes in order to protect the user from a
malicious application. With this architecture, a user's private keys are never
exposed to a dapp in plain text.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is true that a malicious dapp can try to get a user to sign malicious data.
There are additional measures that can be put in place by the web-based crypto
wallets.</p>
<p>As @tom-teman mentioned, a user can verify legitimacy of a login by verifying
the URL of a new window.</p>
<p>There are additional protections that Authereum has in place to help keep
users safe. Some of these are possible due to the contract-based architecture
of a user's wallet. The following is a non-exhaustive list of Authereum
security features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never expose private keys to a dapp.</li>
<li>Do not broadcast transactions with a value that is greater than a user's daily allowed limit. If a dapp attempts to spend more than what a user has specified, the transaction will fail.</li>
<li>Set dapp specific limits for users (i.e. daily transaction value limit, limited # of transactions on a single dapp, etc.).</li>
<li>Blacklist applications that have been reported or are acting maliciously.</li>
<li>Optionally require 2-factor authentication per transaction. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Authereum is fully non-custodial and censorship resistant. While the
above features are a part of the Authereum system, they are not required and
can be bypassed by Authereum users if they feel they are being censored.</em></p>

wallets here.</p>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2>Truffle</h2>
<p>As you already did, you migrated a contract. So Truffle can be used for
contract compilation and migration. It aims for easy and fast migration.</p>
<h2>Geth</h2>
<p>Is an Ethereum-client, which means that you can run your own private
blockchain with it. You can adjust your needs by defining for example the
amount of threads you offer for mining. Geth itself is a command line tool,
which can run a full Ethereum node implemented in Go. It provides the <em>command
lines</em> , a <em>Json-rpc server</em> and an <em>interactive console</em> , where you can run
your own scripts written in javascript.</p>
<h2>Ganache</h2>
<p>If you want a GUI, where you can track all deployments and transactions on
your blockchain, you can choose Ganache. It allows you to create your own
private blockchain mainly for testing purposes. It is used for deployment-
testing for example, because there are no real miners on a "ganache-
blockchain", so you can test if your contracts work.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to use <strong>Geth</strong> and <strong>Truffle</strong> if you want to set up your
own blockchain on your local node and then deploy some contracts on it. There
are plenty of manuals online on how to set up your own local node. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own local node with geth</li>
<li>Setting up Ethereum development environment</li>
</ul>
<p>After you created your node, you can deploy some contracts with truffle to it.
I hope I could help you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> : start with Ganache and learn Geth along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Truffle</strong> is a compiler and out of question.</p>
<p>But between <strong>Geth</strong> and <strong>Ganache</strong> :</p>
<p><strong>Why Ganache ?</strong> Because it is easy !</p>
<p>Geth is a real deal , for a small local chain you have to run it's service
first then create genesis block then you need to bring some miner to mine the
transaction to the blockchain and generate some eath! then you can migrate
smart contract to it but Ganache will do all of that for you!</p>
<p><strong>Why use Geth?</strong> from here :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1- Geth is the official client software provided by the Ethereum foundation.</p>
<p>2- Comes with a JavaScript console (run it with <code>geth console</code>).</p>
<p>3- Has an interoperable JavaScript client (web3js).</p>
<p>4- Built-in access to the Rinkeby test net (or build your own private
Ethereum network).</p>
<p>5- It is generally considered to be the reference implementation for other
Ethereum nodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my experience at this time/date, Ganache cloud be buggy and will give you
some errors irrelevant to your code , but if you need to migrate your code to
a test nest like Rinkeby Testnet, eventually you need to learn Geth.</p>
