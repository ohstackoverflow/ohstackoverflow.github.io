    <p>I cannot seem to get the DevTools Devices feature to work on my Samsung Galaxy
S4 even after following the steps outlined at
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/</p>
<p>My device has Chrome v32 and Chrome Beta v33, while my PC has Chrome v33 and
Chrome Canary v35.</p>
<p>USB debugging is enabled on my device and device driver has been installed. I
have never got the prompt as outline in step 3 from the above link to approve
the RSA key fingerprint yet the device does connect to my PC to allow media
transfer. I have even revoked all USB debugging authorizations as per the link
above.</p>
<p>I don't have any thing extra installed on my PC for Android development which
may perhaps be the issue. I wish to utilise this feature to inspect web pages
from the devices point of view.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>To get the functionality up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow steps at https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging</li>
<li>Install Windows USB driver http://developer.samsung.com/android/tools-sdks/Samsung-Android-USB-Driver-for-Windows</li>
<li>Install Android SDK http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</li>
<li>Install Android SDK Platform-tools http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html (this step was blocked on corporate wifi so I installed the single ADB package it required https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790)</li>
<li>Use command prompt to run ADB, in cmd go to the install directory of the ADB tools and type:</li>
<li>
<code>adb.exe</code> (might need to start and stop ADB using <code>adb kill-server</code> and <code>adb start-server</code>)</li>
<li>Connect phone and browse to <code>about:inspect</code> in Chrome on desktop, ensuring a Chrome browser is open on your device</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the above steps I got the RSA key fingerprint prompt to accept then
I saw my device in Chrome.</p>
<p>Definitely not as easy as I thought it would have been but at least it now
works.</p>
<p><strong>Update 24 February 2016</strong></p>
<p>So I updated to Windows 10 and now have a Samsung Galaxy S5, devices running
Chrome v48.0.2564.116 m and v48.0.2564.95 respectively. Followed the steps
from the Google docs and...it didn't work again, no RSA key prompt. So I began
to follow my steps as above and thought there had to be a faster way as the
Android SDK was over 1GB download.</p>
<p>This time I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow steps at https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging</li>
<li>Install Windows USB driver http://developer.samsung.com/android/tools-sdks/Samsung-Andorid-USB-Driver-for-Windows (the PC alerted me saying it was already installed but I still did it anyway)</li>
<li>Install the single ADB package required https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790)</li>
<li>Go to the ADB install folder which for me was <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Minimal ADB and Fastboot\</code>
</li>
<li>Open command prompt and run <code>adb devices</code> (alternatively I could have run <code>adb start-server</code> but the prior gives a more informational response)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with Chrome open on my phone and <code>chrome://inspect/</code> open on my desktop I
can see the inspect options.</p>
<p>Next problem: I need to repeat the same steps each time I reboot Windows. To
solve that issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a text editor and copy in <code>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Minimal ADB and Fastboot\adb" devices</code>
</li>
<li>Save that file as <code>adb.bat</code> in the Windows Startup folder located at <code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that the file does NOT need to be called adb.bat as long as it is a .bat
file. The command you copied into the file has the default install path which
you may need to alter for your set up.</em></p>
<p>Now I have the Chrome Inspect feature working when I need it.</p>
<p>Bit thanks and shout out to all others who have contributed their answers to
this question which helped guide me towards a useful update to my answer.
Please give credit to other answers where you find they have helped you too.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>On a Galaxy S7 and Windows 10 laptop, all I had to do whilst connected to the
computer was change the USB connection mode to <strong>"Audio Source"</strong> (Phone
Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; USB Configuration).</p>
<p>This then immediately came up with the on-device prompt to allow the RSA key
fingerprint. Then the dev tools on computer recognised my device.</p>
<p>Why this works I do not know, however it is by far the simplest of solutions,
and without the need for installing unnecessary software.</p>
<p><del>I have also had some luck changing it to <strong>"MTP (Media Transfer Protocol)"</strong>
mode too, but only on occasion.</del></p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>The MTP option no longer works for me.</p>
<p>In addition to <strong>Audio Source</strong> , setting the connection mode to <strong>MIDI</strong> also
works. It is alot easier to change the connection mode by accessing it
straight from the device's notification bar - Tap the "Transferring media
files via USB" or the equivalent notification.</p>
<p>Using <strong>MIDI</strong> is probably the easiest of the two since it doesn't require
going into several setting screens to access it.</p>

    <p>The C# compiler requires that whenever a custom type defines operator <code>==</code>, it
must also define <code>!=</code> (see here).</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I'm curious to know why the designers thought it necessary and why can't the
compiler default to a reasonable implementation for either of the operators
when only the other is present. For example, Lua lets you define only the
equality operator and you get the other for free. C# could do the same by
asking you to define either == or both == and != and then automatically
compile the missing != operator as <code>!(left == right)</code>.</p>
<p>I understand that there are weird corner cases where some entities may neither
be equal nor unequal, (like IEEE-754 NaN's), but those seem like the
exception, not the rule. So this doesn't explain why the C# compiler designers
made the exception the rule.</p>
<p>I've seen cases of poor workmanship where the equality operator is defined,
then the inequality operator is a copy-paste with each and every comparison
reversed and every &amp;&amp; switched to a || (you get the point... basically !(a==b)
expanded through De Morgan's rules). That's poor practice that the compiler
could eliminate by design, as is the case with Lua.</p>
<p>Note: The same holds for operators &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=. I can't imagine cases where
you'll need to define these in unnatural ways. Lua lets you define only &lt; and
&lt;= and defines &gt;= and &gt; naturally through the formers' negation. Why doesn't
C# do the same (at least 'by default')?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>Apparently there are valid reasons to allow the programmer to implement checks
for equality and inequality however they like. Some of the answers point to
cases where that may be nice.</p>
<p>The kernel of my question, however, is why this is forcibly required in C#
when <em>usually</em> it's not <em>logically</em> necessary?</p>
<p>It is also in striking contrast to design choices for .NET interfaces like
<code>Object.Equals</code>, <code>IEquatable.Equals</code> <code>IEqualityComparer.Equals</code> where the lack
of a <code>NotEquals</code> counterpart shows that the framework considers <code>!Equals()</code>
objects as unequal and that's that. Furthermore, classes like <code>Dictionary</code> and
methods like <code>.Contains()</code> depend exclusively on the aforementioned interfaces
and do not use the operators directly even if they are defined. In fact, when
ReSharper generates equality members, it defines both <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> in terms
of <code>Equals()</code> and even then only if the user chooses to generate operators at
all. The equality operators aren't needed by the framework to understand
object equality.</p>
<p>Basically, the .NET framework doesn't care about these operators, it only
cares about a few <code>Equals</code> methods. The decision to require both == and !=
operators to be defined in tandem by the user is related purely to the
language design and not object semantics as far as .NET is concerned.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I can't speak for the language designers, but from what I can reason on, it
seems like it was intentional, proper design decision.</p>
<p>Looking at this basic F# code, you can compile this into a working library.
This is legal code for F#, and only overloads the equality operator, not the
inequality:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">module</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Module1</span>

</pre></div>

<p>This does exactly what it looks like. It creates an equality comparer on <code>==</code>
only, and checks to see if the internal values of the class are equal.</p>
<p>While you can't create a class like this in C#, you <em>can</em> use one that was
compiled for .NET. It's obvious it will use our overloaded operator for <code>==</code>
So, what does the runtime use for <code>!=</code>?</p>
<p>The C# EMCA standard has a whole bunch of rules (section 14.9) explaining how
to determine which operator to use when evaluating equality. To put it overly-
simplified and thus not perfectly accurate, if the types that are being
compared are of the same type <em>and</em> there is an overloaded equality operator
present, it will use that overload and not the standard reference equality
operator inherited from Object. It is no surprise, then, that if only one of
the operators is present, it will use the default reference equality operator,
that all objects have, there is not an overload for it.1</p>
<p>Knowing that this is the case, the real question is: Why was this designed in
this way and why doesn't the compiler figure it out on its own? A lot people
are saying this wasn't a design decision, but I like to think it was thought
out this way, especially regarding the fact all objects have a default
equality operator.</p>
<p>So, why doesn't the compiler automagically create the <code>!=</code> operator? I can't
know for sure unless someone from Microsoft confirms this, but this is what I
can determine from reasoning on the facts.</p>
<hr>
<h3>To prevent unexpected behavior</h3>
<p>Perhaps I want to do a value comparison on <code>==</code> to test equality. However,
when it came to <code>!=</code> I didn't care at all if the values were equal unless the
reference was equal, because for my program to consider them equal, I only
care if the references match. After all, this is actually outlined as default
behavior of the C# (if both operators were not overloaded, as would be in case
of some .net libraries written in another language). If the compiler was
adding in code automatically, I could no longer rely on the compiler to output
code that should is compliant. The compiler should not write hidden code that
changes the behavior of yours, especially when the code you've written is
within standards of both C# and the CLI.</p>
<p>In terms of it <em>forcing</em> you to overload it, instead of going to the default
behavior, I can only firmly say that it is in the standard (EMCA-334 17.9.2)2.
The standard does not specify why. I believe this is due to the fact that C#
borrows much behavior from C++. See below for more on this.</p>
<hr>
<h3>When you override <code>!=</code> and <code>==</code>, you do not have to return bool.</h3>
<p>This is another likely reason. In C#, this function:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">operator</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">MyClass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">MyClass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">b</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="c1">; }</span>
</pre></div>

<p>is as valid as this one:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nv">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">bool</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">operator</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">MyClass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">a</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">MyClass</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">b</span><span class="ss">)</span><span class="w"> </span>{<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">true</span><span class="c1">; }</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you're returning something other than bool, the compiler <em>cannot</em>
automatically infer an opposite type. Furthermore, in the case where your
operator <em>does</em> return bool, it just doesn't make sense for them create
generate code that would only exist in that one specific case or, as I said
above, code that hides the default behavior of the CLR.</p>
<hr>
<h3>C# borrows much from C++3</h3>
<p>When C# was introduced, there was an article in MSDN magazine that wrote,
talking about C#:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many developers wish there was a language that was easy to write, read, and
maintain like Visual Basic, but that still provided the power and
flexibility of C++.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes the design goal for C# was to give nearly the same amount of power as C++,
sacrificing only a little for conveniences like rigid type-safety and garbage-
collection. C# was strongly modeled after C++.</p>
<p>You may not be surprised to learn that in C++, the <strong>equality operators do not
have to return bool</strong> , as shown in this example program</p>
<p>Now, C++ does not directly <em>require</em> you to overload the complementary
operator. If your compiled the code in the example program, you will see it
runs with no errors. However, if you tried adding the line:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">cout &lt;&lt; (a != b);
</pre></div>

<p>you will get</p>
<blockquote>
<p>compiler error C2678 (MSVC) : binary '!=' : no operator found which takes a
left-hand operand of type 'Test' (or there is no acceptable conversion)`.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while C++ itself doesn't require you to overload in pairs, it <strong>will not</strong>
let you use an equality operator that you haven't overloaded on a custom
class. It's valid in .NET, because all objects have a default one; C++ does
not.</p>
<hr>
<p>1. As a side note, the C# standard still requires you to overload the pair of
operators if you want to overload either one. This is a part of the <em>standard</em>
and not simply the <em>compiler</em>. However, the same rules regarding the
determination of which operator to call apply when you're accessing a .net
library written in another language that doesn't have the same requirements.</p>
<p>2. EMCA-334 (pdf) (http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-
ST/Ecma-334.pdf)</p>
<p>3. And Java, but that's really not the point here</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Probably for if someone needs to implement three-valued logic (i.e. <code>null</code>).
In cases like that - ANSI standard SQL, for instance - the operators can't
simply be negated depending on the input.</p>
<p>You could have a case where:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">SomeObject</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And <code>a == true</code> returns <code>false</code> and <code>a == false</code> also returns <code>false</code>.</p>

    <p>How do you change the font for the whole document to sans-serif (or anything
else)?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I found the solution thanks to the link in Vincent's answer.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
</pre></div>

<p>This changes the default font family to sans-serif.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>For a different approach, I would suggest using the XeTeX or LuaTex system.
They allow you to access system fonts (TrueType, OpenType, etc) and set font
features. In a typical LaTeX document, you just need to include this in your
headers:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">\usepackage{fontspec}
\defaultfontfeatures{Mapping=tex-text,Scale=MatchLowercase}
\setmainfont{Times}
\setmonofont{Lucida Sans Typewriter}
</pre></div>

<p>It's the <code>fontspec</code> package that allows for <code>\setmainfont</code> and <code>\setmonofont</code>.
The ability to choose a multitude of font features is beyond my expertise, but
I would suggest looking up some examples and seeing if this would suit your
needs.</p>
<p>Just don't forget to replace your favorite latex compiler by the appropriate
one (xelatex or lualatex).</p>
