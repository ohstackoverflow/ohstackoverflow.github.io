    <p>I am trying to understand what shard and replica is in Elasticsearch, but I
didn't manage to understand it. If I download Elasticsearch and run the
script, then from what I know I have started a cluster with a single node. Now
this node (my PC) have 5 shards (?) and some replicas (?).</p>
<p>What are they, do I have 5 duplicates of the index? If so why? I could need
some explanation.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>I'll try to explain with a real example since the answer and replies you got
don't seem to help you.</p>
<p>When you download elasticsearch and start it up, you create an elasticsearch
node which tries to join an existing cluster if available or creates a new
one. Let's say you created your own new cluster with a single node, the one
that you just started up. We have no data, therefore we need to create an
index.</p>
<p>When you create an index (an index is automatically created when you index the
first document as well) you can define how many shards it will be composed of.
If you don't specify a number it will have the default number of shards: 5
primaries. What does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that elasticsearch will create 5 primary shards that will contain
your data:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> ____    ____    ____    ____    ____
| 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |  | 4  |  | 5  |
|____|  |____|  |____|  |____|  |____|
</pre></div>

<p>Every time you index a document, elasticsearch will decide which primary shard
is supposed to hold that document and will index it there. Primary shards are
not a copy of the data, they are the data! Having multiple shards does help
taking advantage of parallel processing on a single machine, but the whole
point is that if we start another elasticsearch instance on the same cluster,
the shards will be distributed in an even way over the cluster.</p>
<p>Node 1 will then hold for example only three shards:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> ____    ____    ____ 
| 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |
|____|  |____|  |____|
</pre></div>

<p>Since the remaining two shards have been moved to the newly started node:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> ____    ____
| 4  |  | 5  |
|____|  |____|
</pre></div>

<p>Why does this happen? Because elasticsearch is a distributed search engine and
this way you can make use of multiple nodes/machines to manage big amounts of
data.</p>
<p>Every elasticsearch index is composed of at least one primary shard since
that's where the data is stored. Every shard comes at a cost, though,
therefore if you have a single node and no foreseeable growth, just stick with
a single primary shard.</p>
<p>Another type of shard is a replica. The default is 1, meaning that every
primary shard will be copied to another shard that will contain the same data.
Replicas are used to increase search performance and for fail-over. A replica
shard is never going to be allocated on the same node where the related
primary is (it would pretty much be like putting a backup on the same disk as
the original data).</p>
<p>Back to our example, with 1 replica we'll have the whole index on each node,
since 2 replica shards will be allocated on the first node and they will
contain exactly the same data as the primary shards on the second node:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> ____    ____    ____    ____    ____
| 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |  | 4R |  | 5R |
|____|  |____|  |____|  |____|  |____|
</pre></div>

<p>Same for the second node, which will contain a copy of the primary shards on
the first node:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> ____    ____    ____    ____    ____
| 1R |  | 2R |  | 3R |  | 4  |  | 5  |
|____|  |____|  |____|  |____|  |____|
</pre></div>

<p>With a setup like this, if a node goes down, you still have the whole index.
The replica shards will automatically become primaries and the cluster will
work properly despite the node failure, as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"> ____    ____    ____    ____    ____
| 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |  | 4  |  | 5  |
|____|  |____|  |____|  |____|  |____|
</pre></div>

<p>Since you have <code>"number_of_replicas":1</code>, the replicas cannot be assigned
anymore as they are never allocated on the same node where their primary is.
That's why you'll have 5 unassigned shards, the replicas, and the cluster
status will be <code>YELLOW</code> instead of <code>GREEN</code>. No data loss, but it could be
better as some shards cannot be assigned.</p>
<p>As soon as the node that had left is backed up, it'll join the cluster again
and the replicas will be assigned again. The existing shard on the second node
can be loaded but they need to be synchronized with the other shards, as write
operations most likely happened while the node was down. At the end of this
operation, the cluster status will become <code>GREEN</code>.</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies things for you.</p>

<p><strong>Shard:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Being distributed search server, <code>ElasticSearch</code> uses concept called <code>Shard</code> to distribute index documents across all nodes.</li>
<li>An <code>index</code> can potentially store a large amount of data that can exceed the hardware limits of a <code>single node</code>
</li>
<li>For example, a single index of a billion documents taking up 1TB of disk space may not fit on the disk of a single node or may be too slow to serve search requests from a single node alone.</li>
<li>To solve this problem, <code>Elasticsearch</code> provides the ability to subdivide your index into multiple pieces called <code>shards</code>.</li>
<li>When you create an index, you can simply define the number of <code>shards</code> that you want.</li>
<li>
<code>Documents</code> are stored in <code>shards</code>, and shards are allocated to <code>nodes</code> in your <code>cluster</code>
</li>
<li>As your <code>cluster</code> grows or shrinks, <code>Elasticsearch</code> will automatically migrate shards between <code>nodes</code> so that the <code>cluster</code> remains balanced.</li>
<li>A shard can be either a <code>primary shard</code> or a <code>replica shard</code>.</li>
<li>Each document in your index belongs to a <code>single primary shard</code>, so the number of primary shards that you have determines the maximum amount of data that your index can hold</li>
<li>A <code>replica shard</code> is just a copy of a primary shard.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Replica:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>Replica shard</code> is the copy of <code>primary Shard</code>, to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure.</li>
<li>
<code>Elasticsearch</code> allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or <code>replicas</code> for short.</li>
<li>An <code>index</code> can also be replicated zero (meaning no replicas) or more times.</li>
<li>The <code>number of shards</code> and replicas can be defined per index at the time the index is created.</li>
<li>After the index is created, you may change the number of replicas dynamically anytime but you <code>cannot change the number of shards</code> after-the-fact.</li>
<li>By default, each index in <code>Elasticsearch</code> is allocated 5 primary Shards and <code>1 replica</code> which means that if you have at least two nodes in your cluster, your index will have 5 primary shards and another 5 replica shards (1 complete replica) for a total of 10 shards per index.</li>

    <p>When I need to filter a data.frame, i.e., extract rows that meet certain
conditions, I prefer to use the <code>subset</code> function:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">subset(airquality, Month == 8 &amp; Temp &gt; 90)
</pre></div>

<p>Rather than the <code>[</code> function:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">airquality[airquality$Month == 8 &amp; airquality$Temp &gt; 90, ]
</pre></div>

<p>There are two main reasons for my preference:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I find the code reads better, from left to right. Even people who know nothing about R could tell what the <code>subset</code> statement above is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because columns can be referred to as variables in the <code>select</code> expression, I can save a few keystrokes. In my example above, I only had to type <code>airquality</code> once with <code>subset</code>, but three times with <code>[</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So I was living happy, using <code>subset</code> everywhere because it is shorter and
reads better, even advocating its beauty to my fellow R coders. But yesterday
my world broke apart. While reading the <code>subset</code> documentation, I notice this
section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>This is a convenience function intended for use interactively. For
programming it is better to use the standard subsetting functions like [,
and in particular the non-standard evaluation of argument subset can have
unanticipated consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could someone help clarify what the authors mean?</p>
<p>First, what do they mean by " <em>for use interactively</em> "? I know what an
interactive session is, as opposed to a script run in BATCH mode but I don't
see what difference it should make.</p>
<p>Then, could you please explain " <em>the non-standard evaluation of argument
subset</em> " and why it is dangerous, maybe provide an example?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>This question was answered in well in the comments by @James, pointing to an
excellent explanation by Hadley Wickham of the dangers of <code>subset</code> (and
functions like it) [here]. Go read it!</p>
<p>It's a somewhat long read, so it may be helpful to record here the example
that Hadley uses that most directly addresses the question of "what can go
wrong?":</p>
<p>Hadley suggests the following example: suppose we want to subset and then
reorder a data frame using the following functions:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">scramble</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nf">sample</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">nrow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">subscramble</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>

<p>This returns the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'cyl' not found</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because R no longer "knows" where to find the object called 'cyl'. He also
points out the truly bizarre stuff that can happen if by chance there is an
object called 'cyl' in the global environment:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">cyl</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">4</span>
<span class="nf">subscramble</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mtcars</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cyl</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">4</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Wow, this requirement goes <em>way back</em> to the 1970s.</p>
<p>In the <em>very early</em> days of pre-standardised C, if you wanted to invoke the
<em>preprocessor</em> , then you had to write a <code>#</code> as the first thing in the first
line of a source file. Writing <em>only</em> a <code>#</code> at the top of the file affords
flexibility in the placement of the other preprocessor directives.</p>
<p>From an original C draft by the great Dennis Ritchie himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>12. Compiler control lines</h3>
<p>[...] In order to cause [the] preprocessor to be invoked, it is necessary
that the very first line of the program begin with #. Since null lines are
ignored by the preprocessor, this line need contain no other information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That document makes for great reading (and allowed me to jump on this question
like a mad cat).</p>
<p>I suspect it's the lecturer simply being sentimental - it hasn't been required
certainly since ANSI C.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<h2>It Does Nothing</h2>
<p>As of the ISO standard of C/C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A preprocessing directive of the form</p>
<p><code># new-line</code></p>
<p>has no effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in today's compilers, that <strong>empty hash does not do anything</strong> (like- <code>new-
line ;</code> has no functionality).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PS</strong> : In * pre-standardized C*, <code># new-line</code> had an important role, it was
used to invoke the C Pre-Processor (as pointed out by @Bathsheba). So, the
code here was either written within that time period, or came from the habit
of the programmer.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> : recently I have come across code like this-</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="cp">#ifdef ANDROID</span>
<span class="cp">#</span>
<span class="cp">#define DEVICE_TAG "ANDROID"</span>
<span class="cp">#define DEBUG_ENABLED</span>
<span class="cp">#</span>
<span class="cp">#else</span>
<span class="cp">#</span>
<span class="cp">#define DEVICE_TAG "NOT_ANDROID"</span>
<span class="cp">#</span>
<span class="cp">#endif </span><span class="cm">/* ANDROID */</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here, those empty hashes are there only for making the code look good. It also
improves readability by indicating that it is a <strong>preprocessor block</strong>.</p>
