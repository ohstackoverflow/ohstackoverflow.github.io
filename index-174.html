    <p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of
years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system
to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word
'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can
recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>
<p><img alt="Template matching" src="images/irQtR.png"></p>
<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>
<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>
<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>
<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely "too much" on color detection).</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>
<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my
algorithm totally fail):</p>
<p><img alt="Total fail" src="images/Byw82.png"></p>
<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a
decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong> : Done in C++ using OpenCV library.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong> : For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image
into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on "red" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with. <img alt="Binarized image" src="images/ktdAB.png">
</li>
<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>
<li>Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps. <img alt="Contour detection" src="images/F9319.png">
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Algorithm</strong> : The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this
awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform
(pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>
<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>
<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will "learn".</li>
<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the
pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so
you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and
will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>
<p><img alt="GHT" src="images/wxrT1.png"></p>
<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the
location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation
and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor
will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> : Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was
severely lacking in some areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>
<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>
<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>
<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively
OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>
<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I
think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>An alternative approach would be to extract features (keypoints) using the
scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) or Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF).</p>
<p>You can find a nice <code>OpenCV</code> code example in <code>Java</code>, <code>C++</code>, and <code>Python</code> on
this page: <em>Features2D + Homography to find a known object</em></p>
<p>Both algorithms are invariant to scaling and rotation. Since they work with
features, you can also handle occlusion (as long as enough keypoints are
visible).</p>
<p><img alt="Enter image description here" src="images/kF63R.jpg"></p>
<p>Image source: tutorial example</p>
<p>The processing takes a few hundred ms for SIFT, SURF is bit faster, but it not
suitable for real-time applications. ORB uses FAST which is weaker regarding
rotation invariance.</p>
<h4>The original papers</h4>
<ul>
<li>SURF: Speeded Up Robust Features</li>
<li>Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints</li>
<li>ORB: an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>To speed things up, I would take advantage of the fact that you are not asked
to find an arbitrary image/object, but specifically one with the Coca-Cola
logo. This is significant because this logo is very distinctive, and it should
have a characteristic, scale-invariant signature in the frequency domain,
particularly in the red channel of RGB. That is to say, the alternating
pattern of red-to-white-to-red encountered by a horizontal scan line (trained
on a horizontally aligned logo) will have a distinctive "rhythm" as it passes
through the central axis of the logo. That rhythm will "speed up" or "slow
down" at different scales and orientations, but will remain proportionally
equivalent. You could identify/define a few dozen such scanlines, both
horizontally and vertically through the logo and several more diagonally, in a
starburst pattern. Call these the "signature scan lines."</p>
<p><img alt="Signature scan line" src="images/KWVZw.jpg"></p>
<p>Searching for this signature in the target image is a simple matter of
scanning the image in horizontal strips. Look for a high-frequency in the red-
channel (indicating moving from a red region to a white one), and once found,
see if it is followed by one of the frequency rhythms identified in the
training session. Once a match is found, you will instantly know the scan-
line's orientation and location in the logo (if you keep track of those things
during training), so identifying the boundaries of the logo from there is
trivial.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if this weren't a linearly-efficient algorithm, or nearly
so. It obviously doesn't address your can-bottle discrimination, but at least
you'll have your logos.</p>
<p>(Update: for bottle recognition I would look for coke (the brown liquid)
adjacent to the logo -- that is, <em>inside</em> the bottle. Or, in the case of an
empty bottle, I would look for a <em>cap</em> which will always have the same basic
shape, size, and distance from the logo and will typically be all white or
red. Search for a solid color eliptical shape where a cap <em>should</em> be,
relative to the logo. Not foolproof of course, but your goal here should be to
find the <em>easy</em> ones <em>fast</em>.)</p>
<p>(It's been a few years since my image processing days, so I kept this
suggestion high-level and conceptual. I think it might slightly approximate
how a human eye might operate -- or at least how my brain does!)</p>

    <p>This is one of the minor CSS problems that plague me constantly.</p>
<p>How do folks around Stack Overflow vertically align <em><strong><code>checkboxes</code></strong></em> and
their <em><strong><code>labels</code></strong></em> consistently <strong>cross-browser</strong>?</p>
<p>Whenever I align them correctly in Safari (usually using <code>vertical-align:
baseline</code> on the <code>input</code>), they're completely off in Firefox and IE.</p>
<p>Fix it in Firefox, and Safari and IE are inevitably messed up. I waste time on
this every time I code a form.</p>
<p>Here's the standard code that I work with:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;form&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"checkbox"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>Label<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>I usually use Eric Meyer's reset, so form elements are relatively clean of
overrides. Looking forward to any tips or tricks that you have to offer!</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2>Warning! This answer is <em><strong>too old</strong></em> and <em><strong>doesn't work</strong></em> on modern</h2>
<p>browsers.</p>
<p>I'm not the poster of this answer, but at the time of writing this, this is
the most voted answer by far in both positive and negative votes (+1035 -17),
and it's still marked as accepted answer (probably because the original poster
of the question is the one who wrote this answer).</p>
<p>As already noted many times in the comments, this answer does not work on most
browsers anymore (and seems to be failing to do that since 2013).</p>
<hr>
<p>After over an hour of tweaking, testing, and trying different styles of
markup, I think I may have a decent solution. The requirements for this
particular project were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inputs must be on their own line.</li>
<li>Checkbox inputs need to align vertically with the label text similarly (if not identically) across all browsers.</li>
<li>If the label text wraps, it needs to be indented (so no wrapping down underneath the checkbox).</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I get into any explanation, I'll just give you the code:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">label<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>display:<span class="w"> </span>block;
<span class="w">  </span>padding-left:<span class="w"> </span>15px;
<span class="w">  </span>text-indent:<span class="w"> </span>-15px;
}
input<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>width:<span class="w"> </span>13px;
<span class="w">  </span>height:<span class="w"> </span>13px;
<span class="w">  </span>padding:<span class="w"> </span>0;
<span class="w">  </span>margin:0;
<span class="w">  </span>vertical-align:<span class="w"> </span>bottom;
<span class="w">  </span>position:<span class="w"> </span>relative;
<span class="w">  </span>top:<span class="w"> </span>-1px;
<span class="w">  </span>*overflow:<span class="w"> </span>hidden;
}


<span class="nt">&lt;form&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"checkbox"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span>Label<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here is the working example in JSFiddle.</p>
<p>This code assumes that you're using a reset like Eric Meyer's that doesn't
override form input margins and padding (hence putting margin and padding
resets in the input CSS). Obviously in a live environment you'll probably be
nesting/overriding stuff to support other input elements, but I wanted to keep
things simple.</p>
<p>Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>*overflow</code> declaration is an inline IE hack (the star-property hack). Both IE 6 and 7 will notice it, but Safari and Firefox will properly ignore it. I think it might be valid CSS, but you're still better off with conditional comments; just used it for simplicity.</li>
<li>As best I can tell, the only <code>vertical-align</code> statement that was consistent across browsers was <code>vertical-align: bottom</code>. Setting this and then relatively positioning upwards behaved almost identically in Safari, Firefox and IE with only a pixel or two of discrepancy.</li>
<li>The major problem in working with alignment is that IE sticks a bunch of mysterious space around input elements. It isn't padding or margin, and it's damned persistent. Setting a width and height on the checkbox and then <code>overflow: hidden</code> for some reason cuts off the extra space and allows IE's positioning to act very similarly to Safari and Firefox.</li>
<li>Depending on your text sizing, you'll no doubt need to adjust the relative positioning, width, height, and so forth to get things looking right.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't tried this specific technique on any projects other than the one I
was working on this morning, so definitely pipe up if you find something that
works more consistently.</p>

<h3>Suggest</h3>
<p>Sometimes vertical-align needs two inline (span, label, input, etc...)
elements next to each other to work properly. The following checkboxes are
properly vertically centered in IE, Safari, FF, and Chrome, even if the text
size is very small or large.</p>
<p>They all float next to each other on the same line, but the nowrap means that
the whole label text always stays next to the checkbox.</p>
<p>The downside is the extra meaningless SPAN tags.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">.checkboxes<span class="w"> </span>label<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>display:<span class="w"> </span>inline-block;
<span class="w">  </span>padding-right:<span class="w"> </span>10px;
<span class="w">  </span>white-space:<span class="w"> </span>nowrap;
}
.checkboxes<span class="w"> </span>input<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>vertical-align:<span class="w"> </span>middle;
}
.checkboxes<span class="w"> </span>label<span class="w"> </span>span<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>vertical-align:<span class="w"> </span>middle;
}


<span class="nt">&lt;form&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;div</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"checkboxes"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"checkbox"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Label<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="w"> </span>x<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"checkbox"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Label<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="w"> </span>y<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"checkbox"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>Label<span class="w"> </span>text<span class="w"> </span>z<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, if you had a very long label text that <em>needed</em> to wrap without wrapping
under the checkbox, you'd use padding and negative text indent on the label
elements:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">.checkboxes<span class="w"> </span>label<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>display:<span class="w"> </span>block;
<span class="w">  </span>padding-right:<span class="w"> </span>10px;
<span class="w">  </span>padding-left:<span class="w"> </span>22px;
<span class="w">  </span>text-indent:<span class="w"> </span>-22px;
}
.checkboxes<span class="w"> </span>input<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>vertical-align:<span class="w"> </span>middle;
}
.checkboxes<span class="w"> </span>label<span class="w"> </span>span<span class="w"> </span>{
<span class="w">  </span>vertical-align:<span class="w"> </span>middle;

    <p>This is valid and returns the string <code>"10"</code> in JavaScript (more examples
here):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">console.log(++[[]][+[]]+[+[]])
</pre></div>

<p>Why? What is happening here?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>If we split it up, the mess is equal to:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">++[[]][+[]]
+
[+[]]
</pre></div>

<p>In JavaScript, it is true that <code>+[] === 0</code>. <code>+</code> converts something into a
number, and in this case it will come down to <code>+""</code> or <code>0</code> (see specification
details below).</p>
<p>Therefore, we can simplify it (<code>++</code> has precendence over <code>+</code>):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">++[[]][0]
+
[0]
</pre></div>

<p>Because <code>[[]][0]</code> means: get the first element from <code>[[]]</code>, it is true that:</p>
<p><code>[[]][0]</code> returns the inner array (<code>[]</code>). Due to references it's wrong to say
<code>[[]][0] === []</code>, but let's call the inner array <code>A</code> to avoid the wrong
notation.</p>
<p><code>++</code> before its operand means “increment by one and return the incremented
result”. So <code>++[[]][0]</code> is equivalent to <code>Number(A) + 1</code> (or <code>+A + 1</code>).</p>
<p>Again, we can simplify the mess into something more legible. Let's substitute
<code>[]</code> back for <code>A</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">(+[] + 1)
+
[0]
</pre></div>

<p>Before <code>+[]</code> can coerce the array into the number <code>0</code>, it needs to be coerced
into a string first, which is <code>""</code>, again. Finally, <code>1</code> is added, which
results in <code>1</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(+[] + 1) === (+"" + 1)</code></li>
<li><code>(+"" + 1) === (0 + 1)</code></li>
<li><code>(0 + 1) === 1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's simplify it even more:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="mf">1</span>
<span class="o">+</span>
<span class="err">[</span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="err">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Also, this is true in JavaScript: <code>[0] == "0"</code>, because it's joining an array
with one element. Joining will concatenate the elements separated by <code>,</code>. With
one element, you can deduce that this logic will result in the first element
itself.</p>
<p>In this case, <code>+</code> sees two operands: a number and an array. It’s now trying to
coerce the two into the same type. First, the array is coerced into the string
<code>"0"</code>, next, the number is coerced into a string (<code>"1"</code>). <em>Number<code>+</code> String
<code>===</code> String</em>.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">"1" + "0" === "10" // Yay!
</pre></div>

<hr>
<p>Specification details for <code>+[]</code>:</p>
<p>This is quite a maze, but to do <code>+[]</code>, first it is being converted to a string
because that's what <code>+</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11.4.6 Unary + Operator</p>
<p>The unary + operator converts its operand to Number type.</p>
<p>The production UnaryExpression : + UnaryExpression is evaluated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let expr be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return ToNumber(GetValue(expr)).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><code>ToNumber()</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object</p>
<p>Apply the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let primValue be ToPrimitive(input argument, hint String).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return ToString(primValue).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><code>ToPrimitive()</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object</p>
<p>Return a default value for the Object. The default value of an object is
retrieved by calling the [[DefaultValue]] internal method of the object,
passing the optional hint PreferredType. The behaviour of the
[[DefaultValue]] internal method is defined by this specification for all
native ECMAScript objects in 8.12.8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>[[DefaultValue]]</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8.12.8 [[DefaultValue]] (hint)</p>
<p>When the [[DefaultValue]] internal method of O is called with hint String,
the following steps are taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let toString be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of
object O with argument "toString".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If IsCallable(toString) is true then,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Let str be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of
toString, with O as the this value and an empty argument list.</p>
<p>b. If str is a primitive value, return str.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>.toString</code> of an array says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>15.4.4.2 Array.prototype.toString ( )</p>
<p>When the toString method is called, the following steps are taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let array be the result of calling ToObject on the this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let func be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of array
with argument "join".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If IsCallable(func) is false, then let func be the standard built-in
method Object.prototype.toString (15.2.4.2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of func
providing array as the this value and an empty arguments list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So <code>+[]</code> comes down to <code>+""</code>, because <code>[].join() === ""</code>.</p>
<p>Again, the <code>+</code> is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11.4.6 Unary + Operator</p>
<p>The unary + operator converts its operand to Number type.</p>
<p>The production UnaryExpression : + UnaryExpression is evaluated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let expr be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return ToNumber(GetValue(expr)).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><code>ToNumber</code> is defined for <code>""</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MV of StringNumericLiteral ::: [empty] is 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <code>+"" === 0</code>, and thus <code>+[] === 0</code>.</p>
<p><br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>++[ [] ][+[]] === 1</code><ul>
<li><code>+[] === 0</code></li>
<li><code>++[ [] ][0] === 1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>[ +[] ]</code> is <code>[ 0 ]</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have a string concatenation:</p>
<p><code>1 + String([ 0 ]) === 10</code></p>
